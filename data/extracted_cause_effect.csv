2024-DON540,2024-DON540,2024-DON540,Assessment,"Marburg virus disease (MVD) is caused by the same family of viruses (Filoviridae) that causes Ebola virus disease. MVD is an epidemic-prone disease associated with high CFR (24-88%). In the early course of the disease, MVD is challenging to distinguish from other infectious diseases such as malaria, typhoid fever, shigellosis, meningitis and other viral haemorrhagic fevers. Epidemiologic features can help differentiate between viral hemorrhagic fevers (including history of exposure to bats, caves, or mining) and laboratory testing is important to confirm the diagnosis. With 62 confirmed cases reported, this is the third largest MVD outbreak reported, with the&nbsp;majority of confirmed cases reported among healthcare workers. Healthcare-associated infections (also known as nosocomial infections) of this disease can lead to further spread if not controlled early. The importance of screening all persons entering health facilities as well as inpatient surveillance for prompt identification, isolation, and notification cannot be overemphasized. This is in addition to the importance of contact identification and monitoring of all probable and confirmed cases. The source of the outbreak, the likely date of onset of the first case and additional epidemiological information on cases are still pending further outbreak investigation.&nbsp; On 30 September WHO assessed the risk of this outbreak as very high at the national level, high at the regional level, and low at the global level. However, based on the evolution of the outbreak and ongoing investigations, this risk assessment may be revised. MVD is not&nbsp;easily transmissible (i.e. in most instances it requires contact with the body fluids of a sick patient presenting with symptoms or with surfaces contaminated with these fluids). In addition, there are ongoing public health measures in place, including active surveillance in facilities and communities, testing suspected cases, isolation and treatment of cases and contact tracing.","[('the same family of viruses (Filoviridae)', 'Marburg virus disease (MVD)'), ('the&nbsp;majority of confirmed cases reported among healthcare workers.', 'Healthcare-associated infections (also known as nosocomial infections) of this disease can lead to further spread if not controlled early.'), ('the source of the outbreak', 'additional epidemiological information on cases are still pending further outbreak investigation.'), ('Contact with body fluids of a sick patient or contaminated surfaces.', 'Transmission of the disease to others.')]"
2024-DON538,2024-DON538,2024-DON538,Assessment,"Although
no cases of WNV have been documented in birds or horses in the country, it is
possible that the virus is circulating in these populations undetected. Despite
this, the overall impact on public health remains limited at this stage, as
there is currently only one recorded human case and appropriate public health
response measures have been implemented, as described above.&nbsp;The
risk of international dissemination of WNV from Barbados is low. The virus is
primarily transmitted through mosquito bites, with birds as the natural hosts.
There is no evidence to suggest that WNV spreads easily between humans or from
horses to mosquitoes. Therefore, the potential for widespread international
transmission remains low.&nbsp;Based
on these criteria, the overall risk related to the public health remains low.
WHO will continue to evaluate the epidemiological situation in Barbados.&nbsp;","[('The primary cause of WNV is mosquito bites, with birds serving as natural hosts.', 'The overall impact of WNV on public health remains limited at this stage, primarily due to the low risk of international dissemination and the effectiveness of implemented public health response measures.'), ('the potential for widespread international transmission remains low.', 'low public health risk')]"
2024-DON536,2024-DON536,2024-DON536,Assessment,"Since the first report of MERS-CoV in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) in 2012 until now, human infections have been reported in 27 countries, spanning all six WHO regions. The majority of MERS-CoV cases (2205; 84%), have been reported in KSA, including this newly reported case.The notification of this case does not change the overall risk assessment. The new case reported is believed to have acquired MERS-CoV infection locally within KSA. However, the potential for international transmission is increased due to the fact that the individual visited Pakistan, while a high-risk contact traveled to South Asia within the 14-day follow-up period. Both individuals had arranged their travels prior to the occurrence of the event and before the test results of the case were obtained and disseminated.WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East and/or other countries where MERS-CoV is circulating in dromedaries. In addition, cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who were exposed to the virus through contact with dromedaries or their products (for example, consumption of raw camel milk), or in a health-care setting. Human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV may occur if there are delays in identifying the infection, particularly in countries that are not well-acquainted with the disease, as well as slow triage of suspected cases and delays in the implementation of standard infection prevention and control measures.&nbsp;WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessments based on the latest available information.&nbsp;","[('local acquisition of MERS-CoV infection within KSA', 'increased potential for international transmission of MERS-CoV'), (""the individual's visit to Pakistan and subsequent high-risk contact in South Asia."", 'potential cases of MERS-CoV infection.'), ('Delayed identification of the infection in countries with limited disease awareness.', 'Human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV.'), ('Risk assessments are likely being conducted due to concerns about safety or uncertainty.', 'The purpose of these risk assessments is to inform decision-making and ensure that measures are taken to mitigate potential risks.')]"

MVD is an epidemic-prone disease associated with high CFR (24-88%). In the early course of the disease clinical diagnosis of MVD is challenging to distinguish from other infectious diseases such as malaria, typhoid fever, shigellosis, meningitis and other viral haemorrhagic fevers. Epidemiologic features can help differentiate between viral hemorrhagic fevers (including history of exposure to bats, caves, or mining) and laboratory testing is important to confirm the diagnosis.&nbsp;The notification of 26 confirmed cases, of which over 70% are healthcare workers from two different health facilities in the country is of great concern. Healthcare-associated infections (also known as nosocomial infections) of this disease can lead to further spread if not controlled early. The importance of screening all persons entering health facilities as well as inpatient surveillance for prompt identification, isolation, and notification cannot be overemphasized. This is in addition to the importance of contact identification and monitoring of all probable and confirmed cases. The source of the outbreak, geographical extent, the likely date of onset, and additional epidemiological information on cases are still pending further outbreak investigation.&nbsp;There is a risk of this outbreak spreading to neighbouring countries since cases have been reported in districts located at the borders with the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the United Republic of Tanzania, and Uganda. Further risk of international spread is also high as confirmed cases have been reported in the capital city with an international airport and road networks to several cities in East Africa. A contact is known to have travelled internationally, to Belgium, and appropriate response measures have been implemented. &nbsp;Optimized supportive care for patients, which includes careful monitoring, intravenous fluid, and early treatment of complications, can improve patient survival. There are promising vaccines and therapeutic candidates for MVD, but these must be proven in clinical trials. &nbsp;WHO has provided guidance to the Ministry of Health on how to manage cases.

2024-DON534,2024-DON534,2024-DON534,Assessment,"This is the first human case of infection with a zoonotic influenza virus notified by Ghana. Laboratory testing confirmed the virus as an influenza A(H9N2) virus.The majority of human infections with A(H9N2) viruses occur due to contact with infected poultry or environments that have been contaminated and typically result in mild clinical symptoms. Further human cases in persons with exposure to the virus in infected animals or through contaminated environments can be expected since the virus continues to be detected in poultry populations. To date, there has been no reported sustained human-to-human transmission humans of A(H9N2) viruses.The existing epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that this virus has not acquired the capacity for sustained transmission among humans. Thus, the likelihood of sustained human-to-human spread is low. Should infected individuals from affected areas travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during travel or after arrival. However, if this occurs, further community-level spread is considered unlikely.","[('Contact with infected poultry or environments that have been contaminated.', 'Mild clinical symptoms.'), ('The cause is that the existing epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that this virus has not acquired the capacity for sustained transmission among humans.', 'The effect is that the likelihood of sustained human-to-human spread is low, but infected individuals may be detected in another country during travel or after arrival.')]"
2024-DON532,2024-DON532,2024-DON532,Assessment,"Human infections with swine-origin influenza viruses have been reported in recent years from many countries. Most human cases with influenza A(H1N1)v virus infection result from exposure to swine influenza viruses through direct contact with infected swine or indirectly through contaminated environments. However, a few cases have been reported without an apparent source of exposure to swine in the weeks prior to illness onset. Because these viruses continue to be detected in swine populations worldwide, further human cases following direct or indirect contact with infected swine can be expected. Limited, non-sustained human-to-human transmission of variant influenza viruses has been described, although ongoing community transmission has never been identified. Current evidence suggests that these viruses have not acquired the capacity for sustained transmission among humans. According to the information available thus far, no further human cases of infection with A(H1N1)v viruses associated with this case have been detected.Based on the available information, WHO assesses the current risk to the general population posed by this virus to be low. Further virus characterization is ongoing. The risk assessment will be reviewed should further epidemiological or virological information become available.","[('Direct or indirect contact with infected swine or contaminated environments.', 'Human infections with swine-origin influenza viruses.'), ('indirect contact with infected swine', 'Limited, non-sustained human-to-human transmission of variant influenza viruses'), ('The virus.', 'A low risk assessment due to ongoing further epidemiological or virological information.')]"
2024-DON533,2024-DON533,2024-DON533,Assessment,"From
2003 to 20 August 2024, a total of 903 human cases of infection of influenza
A(H5N1) have been reported globally to WHO from 24 countries, including this
case. Almost all cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H5N1) have
been linked to close contact with A(H5N1)-infected live or dead birds or
mammals, or contaminated environments. Available
epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that A(H5N1) viruses have not
acquired the capacity for sustained transmission among humans. Therefore, the
likelihood of sustained human-to-human spread is low at present. Since the
virus continues to circulate in poultry, particularly in rural areas in
Cambodia, further sporadic human cases can be expected. Currently,
based on available information, WHO assesses the overall public health risk
posed by this virus to be low. The risk assessment will be reviewed as needed
if additional information becomes available.&nbsp;Close
analysis of the epidemiological situation, further characterization of the most
recent influenza A(H5N1) viruses in both human and poultry populations, and
serological investigations are critical to assess associated risks to public
health and promptly adjust risk management measures.&nbsp;Vaccines
against seasonal influenza viruses will not protect humans against infections
with influenza A(H5N1) viruses. Candidate vaccines to prevent influenza A(H5)
infection in humans have been developed for pandemic preparedness in some
countries. WHO continues to update the list of zoonotic
influenza candidate vaccine viruses (CVV), which are selected twice a year at
the WHO consultation on influenza virus vaccine composition. The list of such

2024-DON530,2024-DON530,2024-DON530,Assessment,"In the Region of the Americas, outbreaks of Oropouche virus disease have occurred mainly in the Amazon region during the last ten years. With geographical limitations, OROV causing persistent endemicity and periodic outbreaks are reported in in both rural and urban communities in Brazil, the Plurinational State of Bolivia, Cuba, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Panama, Peru, and Trinidad and Tobago&nbsp;(7).The ongoing outbreak highlights the need to strengthen epidemiological and entomological surveillance and to reinforce preventive measures in the population. This is crucial due to the potential expansion of the virus's transmission area and the growing understanding of the disease spectrum, including possible new transmission routes, and possible new vectors that could affect both the general population and vulnerable groups, such as pregnant women, their fetuses, and newborns.Based on available information, WHO assesses the overall public health risk posed by this virus to be high at the regional level and low at the global level.

2024-DON528,2024-DON528,2024-DON528,Assessment,"The current expansion of mpox in the African continent is unprecedented. At least four countries have identified cases for the first time and others, such as C&ocirc;te d&rsquo;Ivoire, are reporting re-emerging outbreaks. The modes of transmission in these countries are not fully described yet and are likely to include exclusive human-to-human transmission.&nbsp;Clade I mpox is being identified for the first time outside of the countries that had been previously affected. Initial transmission in the newly affected countries in East Africa and beyond has been linked to travel to or from the Democratic Republic of Congo, but the expansion of the outbreak in Burundi suggests that in some settings, there may already be sustained community transmission. Epidemiological links between confirmed cases are not always known, therefore, multiple transmission chains might be ongoing in the different countries, and more undetected cases in the community are likely. Based on available epidemiological data, this clade has been spreading rapidly among adults through close physical contact, including sexual contact identified within networks of sex workers and their clients. As the virus spreads further, the affected groups are changing, with the virus also taking hold within households and other settings.&nbsp;&nbsp;In areas or congregate settings with high population density as well in high-risk sexual networks, transmission could lead to explosive outbreaks, further compounded by population movements or insecurity. Conversely, the virus can also spread silently along commercial travel routes as in some cases symptoms may be less severe, access to health services in transit may be limited or concerns about stigma may cause persons affected to avoid seeking care.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While vaccination against smallpox was shown in the past to be cross-protective against mpox, any immunity from smallpox vaccination will only be present in persons over the age of 42 to 50 years or older, since natural exposure to smallpox and smallpox vaccination programmes ended in 1980 after smallpox eradication. None of the four newly affected countries has access to mpox vaccines or antivirals.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the above, WHO has separately assessed the risk of mpox in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo and neighbouring countries as high and in Cote d&rsquo;Ivoire, and other West African countries as moderate. This risk applies to the general population, especially those who have sexual contact with a mpox case, as well as health workers if they are not taking appropriate precautions when examining, testing and treating mpox cases.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently no deaths have been reported in the five above mentioned countries, however, there is the potential for increased health impact with wider spread among vulnerable groups such as children, immunocompromised individuals, including persons with uncontrolled HIV infection or advanced HIV disease, or pregnant women in whom mpox can be more severe.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is concern that the mpox outbreak in Africa will continue to evolve given:&nbsp;&nbsp;The evidence of possible under-detection and under-reporting of local transmission. Many reported cases have no established epidemiological link and have been identified in different countries and in different locations within each country.&nbsp;&nbsp;While all of the governments have activated emergency responses in the countries, with support from in-country and global partners, resources to respond remain limited in some of the countries, and resource mobilization may be slow. Technical and financial support is needed to ensure a robust response at national and provincial/local levels.&nbsp;Although the governments and partners are all mobilized to support adequate patient care for affected patients and introduce vaccines for people at risk, these measures are currently not in place in most countries in Africa, and their acquisition and roll-out will still require some time for implementation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since some of the countries have not reported mpox before, public awareness of the disease, as well as knowledge about and capacity for identifying it among health and care workers in newly affected countries remains limited.&nbsp;&nbsp;Concurrently, the global multi-country outbreak of mpox is still ongoing. Countries outside of Africa that seemed to have achieved control of human-to-human transmission continue to detect sporadic cases ` outbreaks, and an unprecedented increase of cases and reporting countries has been observed in the African Region, especially in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, increasing the risk of further transmission in the region and the whole world.&nbsp;",
2024-DON527,2024-DON527,2024-DON527,Assessment,"Globally, there is no systematic surveillance that allows for the routine identification and information collection of hvKp strains. Identification of hvKp is challenging given that it is determined by available laboratory capacity to perform genomic sequencing tests or analysis of specific markers that may indicate hypervirulence, so the prevalence of hvKp-associated infections may be underestimated.&nbsp;Assessing the current risk of hvKp at the global level aims to incorporate several risk components including 1) the emergence and sustained transmission of hvKp carrying carbapenem resistance genes, considering the public health impact of the identified resistance for the AMR related events; 2) the risk of geographical spread; 3) the risk of insufficient control capacities with available resources; and 4) the risk of resistance spread to other bacterial species via mobile genetic elements.&nbsp;The risk at the global level is assessed as moderate considering that:&nbsp;Infections caused by hvKp traditionally have occurred within communities in certain geographical regions (Asia) and are associated with high morbidity and mortality as well as high pathogenicity and limited antibiotic choices. However, recent reports from the WHO European region and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) have shown transmission in health-care settings, and several studies from China have reported clusters of health care-associated infections of hvKp; hence highlighting the importance of strict infection prevention and control (IPC) measures when managing these cases in health-care settings. With the concurrence of hypervirulence and antibiotic resistance, it is expected that there will be an increased risk of spread of these strains at both the community and hospital levels.&nbsp;As with other resistance mechanisms, the risk of spread could increase due to high movements of people (within and between countries and regions).&nbsp;There are very limited antimicrobial treatment options for the carbapenem-resistant hvKp isolates and these strains have the capacity to generate outbreaks.&nbsp;The high conjugation capacity of the carbapenem-resistant hvKp (CR-hvKp) and the potential for further dissemination in clinical settings; hvKp ST23 particularly out-competes other gut bacteria facilitating colonization and spread.&nbsp;Detection of the emergence of multi-resistant or extensively resistant pathogens requires established resistance laboratory surveillance systems as well as effective infection prevention and control programs in health-care facilities.&nbsp;Lack of laboratory capacity contributes to the restriction of laboratory diagnosis, and this affects the sensitivity of the surveillance. Most affected countries do not have the capacity for diagnosis in the clinical setting as the laboratory diagnosis of hvKp infections depends on the availability of molecular tests.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is global heterogeneity in laboratory surveillance capacity for this pathogen; because of this, there is no systematic surveillance (detection, monitoring, and reporting) of hvKp infections in most countries or regions. Outbreaks and cases are documented in a non-systematic way through laboratory surveillance for antimicrobial resistance, or retrospective epidemiological studies, making data on the prevalence of hvKp infections scarce.&nbsp;The prevention and control of carbapenem-resistant hvKp poses significant challenges because it has not been possible to establish the extent of its dissemination in the countries of the different regions and information on this subject is currently limited.&nbsp;The level of confidence in the available information and risk assessment at the global level is moderate given the challenges with surveillance, lack of information on laboratory testing rates, ability to track and determine scale of community transmission, the gap in the available data on infections, hospitalization and from the overall burden of the disease.",
2024-DON526,2024-DON526,2024-DON526,Assessment,"This represents the first report of autochthonous dengue cases ever documented in Iran. The confirmation of local dengue transmission in 2024 is thus an atypical yet foreseeable event due to the presence of the vector in the country and the movement of people from endemic areas to Iran.Based on entomological surveillance, to date, Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus are present in the provinces of Baluchistan, Bushehr, Fars, Gilan, Golestan, Hormozgan, Khuzestan, Mazandaran and Sistan.On 16 May 2024, WHO reassessed the global risk of dengue, confirming it to be high and emphasizing that dengue continues to pose a significant public health threat worldwide.The national risk for Iran is also high due to the presence of the vector in the country, favorable climate conditions for the competent vector and the movement of people from countries experiencing ongoing outbreaks and endemic areas to Iran. There is heightened awareness of the potential increase in importations and subsequent transmission of the disease during the upcoming Arbaeen pilgrimage in August, when millions of people from different countries, including countries reporting dengue cases travel to Iran.",
2024-DON525,2024-DON525,2024-DON525,Assessment,"The sudden appearance of unlinked cases of mpox in South Africa without a history of international travel, the high HIV prevalence among confirmed cases, and the high case fatality ratio suggest that community transmission is underway, and the cases detected to date represent a small proportion of all mpox cases that might be occurring in the community; it is unknown how long the virus may have been circulating. This may in part be due to the lack of early clinical recognition of an infection with which South Africa previously gained little experience during the ongoing global outbreak, potential pauci-symptomatic manifestation of the disease, or delays in care-seeking behaviour due to limited access to care or fear of stigma.&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, most of the transmission in the initial cases is linked to recent sexual contacts among men, similar to the spread in newly affected countries during the 2022-2024 multi-country outbreak. For most confirmed cases, no epidemiological link has been established, possibly due in part to incomplete contact identification. This suggests that undetected community transmission is occurring and that further cases can be expected as surveillance is strengthened. The current risk to human health for the general public remains low in the country. The risk for gay men, bisexual men, other men who have sex with men, trans and gender diverse people, and sex workers is moderate, as currently assessed for the global outbreak. The higher risk assessment is consistent with ongoing transmission among recognized risk groups due mainly to exposure through sexual contact, and the higher prevalence of undetected or uncontrolled HIV infection in the country which also puts people at risk of severe disease. There is potential for increased health impact should wider dissemination continue in vulnerable groups in South Africa or neighbouring countries. Data from ongoing mpox outbreaks show that the risk of severe disease and death is higher among children, immunocompromised individuals including persons with poorly controlled HIV, and pregnant women.&nbsp;&nbsp;The most recent Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) data estimate HIV prevalence among men who have sex with men in South Africa to be around 30%, only 44% of whom are on antiretroviral therapy. This makes this group extremely vulnerable to severe mpox disease and death. There is also a hazard to health workers if they are not appropriately using personal protective equipment (PPE) when caring for patients with mpox.&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to 2022, the CFR for clade II MPXV in West Africa was estimated to be 3.6% (95% CI: 1.7%, 6.8%). Case fatality in the ongoing multi-country outbreak (0.2%) is the lowest recorded for MPXV clade II. In contrast, the CFR among cases reported in South Africa in 2024 is extremely high (15%), as most detected cases are among persons who are immunocompromised with uncontrolled HIV and other co-morbidities. Persons with less severe mpox are less likely to recognize the condition or seek diagnosis and care; therefore, such cases may remain undetected and unreported.&nbsp;Vaccination with mpox vaccines has been shown to be effective against mpox. The last case of smallpox in South Africa was reported in 1972, and smallpox vaccination stopped shortly after the global eradication of the disease in 1980. Thus, any immunity from prior smallpox vaccination (which is cross-protective for mpox) will at best now only be present in some persons over the age of 44 years. The median age of mpox cases in the current global outbreak is 34 years (IQR: 29 - 41) and within South Africa, reported cases are aged between 17-43 years.&nbsp;The limited awareness of mpox and lack of knowledge about practices for prevention among health workers and among key populations such as sex workers or men who have sex with men in the country exacerbates their risk for mpox. Anyone suffering from disfiguring skin conditions, including mpox, may experience fear and stigma, which can be further compounded for key populations.&nbsp;There is concern that the mpox outbreak in South Africa will continue to evolve given:&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;high likelihood of under-detection and under-reporting&nbsp;of local transmission, given that reported cases have to date almost exclusively affected the most vulnerable.Currently, all detected cases have presented with severe&nbsp;disease and extensive skin lesions, which could lead to more viral transmission and risks poor outcomes for the patients.&nbsp;While the government and partners are mobilized to introduce treatment for affected patients and vaccines for people at risk, these countermeasures are&nbsp;not yet widely available in the country.&nbsp;&nbsp;Public awareness&nbsp;of mpox&nbsp;and information about modes of transmission or possible amplifying events or risk of exposure in sex-on-premises venues remains&nbsp;limited in South Africa. &nbsp;&nbsp;Concurrent&nbsp;outbreaks of mpox are occurring in Africa and elsewhere, increasing the risk of further transmission.&nbsp;",
2024-DON522,2024-DON522,2024-DON522,Assessment,"In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, most reported cases in known endemic provinces continue to be among children under 15 years of age, especially in young children. Infants and children under five years of age are at highest risk of severe disease and death, particularly where prompt optimal case management is limited or unavailable. The number of cases reported weekly remains consistently high while the outbreak continues to expand geographically. High test positivity among tested cases in most provinces also suggests that undetected transmission is likely ongoing in the community.&nbsp;Transmission of mpox due to clade I MPXV via sexual contact in key populations was first identified in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2023. In South Kivu province, mpox transmission is sustained through human-to-human contact (sexual and non-sexual).&nbsp; &nbsp;The global outbreak 2022 &mdash; 2024 has shown that sexual contact enables faster and more efficient spread of the virus from one person to another due to direct contact of mucous membranes between people, contact with multiple partners, a possibly shorter incubation period on average, and a longer infectious period for immunocompromised individuals. The newly documented occurrence of mpox in North Kivu is very concerning. The additional public health impact of sustained human-to-human sexual transmission of mpox in the country indicates that a vigorous response is required.&nbsp;One of the main risk factors for severe disease and death among persons with mpox is immune suppression, especially among those with advanced HIV infection. The prevalence of HIV in the general adult population in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is estimated to be approximately 1%, higher in the eastern provinces than elsewhere, and higher in key populations including estimates of a prevalence of 7.5% among sex workers and 7.1% among men who have sex with men. The higher HIV prevalence and the challenge in accessing antiretroviral treatment puts these groups at higher risk for severe mpox and death if they get infected. The occurrence of cases among a broad range of occupational groups and within households also suggests that the outbreak in South Kivu is already spreading into the wider community.&nbsp;Understanding of the dynamics of MPXV transmission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is improving with the emergency measures being put in place. Nonetheless, a lack of timely access to diagnostics in many areas, incomplete epidemiological investigations, challenges in contact tracing and extensive but inconclusive animal investigations continue to hamper rapid response. While zoonotic spill over events are considered to still represent a major source of exposure in the country, the animal reservoir remains unknown. The new features of human-to-human transmission observed in South Kivu and North Kivu raise additional concern about a further rapid expansion of the outbreak in the eastern mining provinces, as well as the rest of the country and other countries which share national borders.&nbsp;From 1 January to 26 May 2024, 7 851 suspected cases were reported, compared to 3 924 suspected cases reported during the same period in 2023. The geographic expansion to new areas, such as Kinshasa and North Kivu, continues in 2024. Only 3 of 26 provinces have not yet reported mpox in 2024. While some cases in the newly affected provinces are linked to travel from endemic areas, others represent secondary or sustained human-to-human transmission, and the source of infection for several of them remains unknown. The current situation remains extremely concerning as MPXV continues to move into the immunity gap left following eradication of smallpox. &nbsp;Surveillance and investigating alerts are limited by logistical and resource challenges, and laboratory capacities are limited to two national laboratories, one in Kinshasa and one in Goma so only 18% of reported cases in 2024 have been tested by PCR. Testing through GeneXpert has begun in Equateur and South Kivu province, and validation of the findings is ongoing. Response capacities to mpox in the country rely to a great extent on the support of WHO and other partners.&nbsp;Immunogenicity and safety studies of MVA-BN vaccine have been ongoing in the Democratic Republic of the Congo since 2016. The national immunization technical advisory group (GTCV) released recommendations on the use of mpox vaccines in the country for persons at risk. These included recommendations for preferred use of LC16 in children and use of MVA-BN in adults. The Ministry of Public Health, Hygiene and Prevention (MSPHP) has announced its intention to vaccinate persons at risk through use of LC16 and MVA-BN vaccinia-based mpox vaccines and asked the national regulatory authority (ACOREP),) to authorize temporary use of these vaccines. This regulatory review is underway. Further clinical efficacy and safety studies are being planned for LC16 in the country. The Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) is developing emergency response immunization strategies for persons and areas at risk through extensive consultation internally, with WHO and with partners.&nbsp;The antiviral medication tecovirimat is undergoing clinical efficacy studies in two study sites in the Democratic Republic of the Congo: Kole in Sankuru Province and Tunde in Maniema Province. This study is expected to complete recruitment in 2024. Access to tecovirimat is possible through request from WHO for compassionate use or through application for use under the WHO MEURI protocol.&nbsp;Risk communication and community engagement are of critical importance for modes of transmission historically reported as community outbreaks including from consumption of bushmeat, as well as for the newly described risk of sexual transmission, particularly among sex workers and other key populations. According to a study conducted by USAID and Breakthrough Action in 2022, awareness of the risks associated with mpox among the general population in the Democratic Republic of the Congo was low, despite the disease being reported in remote endemic areas since 1970. The lack of effective dissemination to date of health messages for key populations such as sex workers or men who have sex with men in the country exposes them to further risk. Anyone suffering from disfiguring skin conditions, including mpox, may suffer from fear and stigma, which can be further compounded for persons at risk of acquiring the disease through sexual contact.&nbsp;The continued development of the mpox outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo remains concerning due to:&nbsp;The continuing high incidence of cases reported in 2024 compared to previous years, with two thirds of reported cases and more than four fifths of deaths occurring primarily among children in known endemic areas.&nbsp;Transmission through sexual contact of clade I MPXV among key populations and other groups with multiple partners and high mobility in densely populated mining areas has led to sustained community transmission in South Kivu.&nbsp;&nbsp;The outbreak characterized by sexual contact transmission has revealed a new strain of MPXV with genetic mutations suggestive of extended human-to-human transmission and geographic expansion. This new MPXV strain is affecting newly reported areas in southern and eastern provinces. While it is not known whether this variant is inherently more transmissible or leads to more severe diseases than other virus strains circulating in the country, co-infections with HIV and other sexually transmitted infections are being documented.&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2023 and 2024, mpox cases have occurred in ​​Kinshasa associated with river boat travel and leading to outbreaks in the city. At the time of reporting, new cases in the Nsele health zone in Kinshasa have been confirmed.&nbsp;There is high (around 70% overall) or very high (around 90% in South Kivu) test positivity among reported cases, despite efforts to significantly expand surveillance. This suggests significant under detection or underreporting of transmission.&nbsp;While the government has activated an emergency response across the country with support from in-country and global partners, resources to respond over such a wide geographic area remain insufficient, and resource mobilization is slow.&nbsp;&nbsp;Public awareness remains limited, resources are scarce, and technical as well as financial support is needed to ensure a robust response at provincial/local, national, and international levels.&nbsp;A concurrent outbreak of mpox is occurring in the Republic of Congo, with cases genetically similar to the MPXV strain circulating in neighbouring endemic provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo provinces.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new outbreak of mpox due to clade IIb MPXV linked to the ongoing global outbreak is occurring among key populations in the Republic of South Africa, with to date only cases with severe disease and advanced HIV infection being reported, suggesting extensive undetected circulation of the virus. Travel between South Africa and the Democratic Republic of the Congo linked to commercial activity between the two countries further puts populations at risk.&nbsp;In epidemiological week 16 to 18, an outbreak of 45 suspected cases of mpox were reported in two prison cells in Lodja Health Zone in Sankuru Province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Samples were collected and sent to the lab for confirmation and results are currently awaited.",

2024-DON518,2024-DON518,2024-DON518,Assessment,"Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease caused by the dengue virus, with the potential to cause a serious public health impact. Dengue infections are the most common vector-borne viral infections worldwide, particularly impacting tropical and subtropical countries.&nbsp; DENV has the potential to cause epidemics resulting in high morbidity and mortality. The virus is primarily transmitted through the bite of infected Aedes mosquitoes, most commonly Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. The proliferation and propagation of mosquitoes depend on climatic factors such as temperature, humidity and rainfall. The arbovirus can be carried by infected travellers (imported cases) and may establish new areas of local transmission in the presence of vectors and a susceptible population. As they are arboviruses, all populations living in areas with the presence of Aedes aegypti are at risk, however, their impact largely affects the most vulnerable people, in which the arboviral disease programs do not have enough resources to respond to outbreaks.&nbsp;&nbsp;Infection with one of the dengue serotypes (1-4) does not provide cross-protective immunity to the others, so persons living in a dengue endemic area can have four dengue infections during their lifetimes. Changes in the predominant circulating serotype increase the population risk of subsequent exposure to a heterologous DENV serotype, which increases the risk of higher rates of severe dengue and deaths.&nbsp; Severe dengue is characterized by vascular leakage, hemorrhagic manifestations, thrombocytopenia, and hypotensive shock, which can lead to organ failure and death. Age, interval between infections, antibody characteristics, viral factors, and host-specific genetics are contributing factors. Monitoring of the global dengue situation to date has shown that several factors are associated with an increasing risk of dengue epidemics becoming more extensive and less predictable, and these include;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Changing distribution of the Aedes aegypti vector; Urbanization and human activities fostering conducive environments for vector-host interaction; Climate change-induced shifts in weather patterns; Fragile healthcare systems amidst political and financial instabilities; Changes in the predominant circulating serotypes and co-circulation of multiple dengue serotypes; Challenges in clinical diagnosis particularly in areas with co-circulation of other arboviruses; Inadequate laboratory and testing capacity; Prolonged ongoing concurrent outbreaks, including COVID-19; Insufficient preparedness for the scale of the epidemic, and low capacity for dengue patient clinical management; Lack of specific treatment for dengue;Lack of engagement and mobilization of local communities in vector control activities; Insufficient vector surveillance and control capacities; Lack of coordination among stakeholders, chronic underfunding, and low donor interest;Lack of involvement of government sectors responsible for addressing social determinants e.g. implementation of policies aimed at improving conditions related to the risk of transmission, such as urban planning, water and sanitation provision, solid waste management, housing improvement, etc. Lack of engagement and mobilization of local communities in vector control activities.WHO assessed the global risk of dengue as high on 30 November 2023, and subsequently assigned a WHO internal emergency response grade of G3 at the global level on 1 December 2023. Given the current scale of the dengue outbreaks, the potential risk of further international spread and the complexity of factors impacting transmission, the overall risk at the global level is still assessed as high and thus dengue remains a global threat to public health.",

WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East and/or other countries where MERS-CoV is circulating in dromedaries. In addition, cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who were exposed to the virus through contact with dromedaries or their products (for example, consumption of raw camel milk), or in a health-care setting.

2024-DON517,2024-DON517,2024-DON517,Assessment,"The outbreak is occurring in the Ouaddai province which has been heavily affected by an influx of refugees and returnees fleeing armed conflict in neighbouring Sudan since April 2023. The majority of hepatitis E cases have been reported from the Adr&eacute; health district hosting three refugee camps with an average of 50&nbsp;000 refugees per camp and a temporary refugee site housing approximately 170&nbsp;000 refugees (UNHCR estimate).The risk at the national level is assessed as high due to the continuous population movements between different refugee camps and host communities; poor hygiene conditions, low access to safe drinking water and improved sanitation facilities including wastewater management as well as limited access to essential medical services in the affected camps; challenges in the management of cases among pregnant women. In addition, the limited financial capacity to effectively contain the outbreak also contributes to increasing the risk of spreading the disease in the Ouaddai province and across the rest of the country.Although no ongoing outbreak of hepatitis E has been reported officially in countries bordering Chad, the overall risk at the regional level is considered moderate because of the continued population movements between Chad and Sudan or the Central African Republic that raise fears of the spread of the epidemic in the sub-region.

2024-DON513,2024-DON513,2024-DON513,Assessment,"The risk at the national level is assessed as &lsquo;High&rsquo; due to the following:&nbsp;The country was previously classified as &ldquo;rabies free&rdquo; and has now reported      the first confirmed human case. As such, experience and awareness of      community and health care workers on rabies are likely limited.Oecusse, the municipality where the current case was bitten and reported from, is      an enclave of Timor-Leste located within East Nusa Tenggara province (NTT)      in Indonesia where rabies is endemic in both dogs and humans, and where      between 1 January and 15 March 2024, six human rabies deaths have been      recorded.Insufficient stock of human rabies vaccines in the government health facilities.The health workers in the areas considered at high risk of rabies have been      trained for dog-bite management. A recent survey shows that 91% of health      workforce in Oecusse have demonstrated knowledge of dog-bite management      including PEP and RIG administration. However, in other parts of      Timor-Leste health workers have limited knowledge dog bite and scratch      case management including PEP and RIG administration. The      rabies case management guidelines have yet to be finalized and training      needs to be conducted on clinical management.Timor-Leste has a significant population owning dogs and more than 70% vaccinated in      the areas bordering Indonesia. Dog vaccination programme is continuing very effectively. Currently more than      35,000 dogs are vaccinated as of 24 April 2024. Despite limited human      resources, 102 dog vaccinators are doing door-do-door campaign in the      border areas and Dili to provide dog vaccine. The frontliners from human health and those considered at higher risk have not      received pre-exposure vaccine due to non-availability of the same.Since Timor-Leste's only land border is with NTT province in Indonesia, which is already endemic for rabies (humans and canines), the risk of the international spread of rabies from Timor-Leste to other countries is unlikely. Available data indicates only the current one fatal case of rabies in Timor-Leste, with no links to international travel, tourism or international gatherings.",

It aimed to reassess the current regional risk of multiple ongoing YF outbreaks, in the context of a resurgence of YF outbreaks in countries with a history of preventive vaccination campaigns and persisting immunity gaps, including capacities to support the response (e.g., technical capacities, vaccine supply and vaccination campaigns, laboratory and operations, support and logistics (OSL)) and to provide recommendations for a more effective and coordinated response.The overall&nbsp;risk at the regional level&nbsp;was re-assessed as&nbsp;moderate based&nbsp;on several contributing factors observed in the region despite the efforts to control the spread of YF:Stable number of&nbsp;ongoing      outbreaks&nbsp;across the region.Persistence of pockets of unimmunized      populations&nbsp;although considerable efforts have been made in recent      years to protect the population through PMVC and reactive mass vaccination      campaigns (RMVC).Detection of YF confirmed cases in      urban areas,&nbsp;such as Douala city in Cameroon, which pose      significant risks due to high population density and international travel      connections, noting nevertheless the risk mitigation provided by a      relatively high average vaccination coverageRisk of cross-border spread,&nbsp;particularly      from the outbreak in South Sudan, which shares borders with neighbouring      countries.Limited surveillance and laboratory      capacity&nbsp;in certain regions may result in delayed detection,      underestimation of the extent of the disease and delayed response.Persisting&nbsp;response challenges&nbsp;with the case classification, investigation, and response operations,      exacerbated by competing health emergencies.Competing outbreaks&nbsp;strainthe capacity to respond effectively, with various simultaneous health crises,      including measles, poliomyelitis, mpox, cholera, diphtheria, hepatitis E,      Lassa fever, and dengue. These challenges are compounded by factors such      as food insecurity, security constraints, and complex humanitarian      contexts. Furthermore, public health and medical personnel are overburdened,      managing multiple parallel outbreaks alongside other health emergencies.Socio-economic factors,&nbsp;high      levels of poverty and limited resource allocation contribute to the      challenge of controlling outbreaks effectively.While the global risk remains low, active surveillance is required due to the potential for onward transmission through viremic travellers and the presence of the competent vector in neighbouring regions.While progress has been made in controlling outbreaks, ongoing challenges and vulnerabilities underscore the need for sustained and coordinated efforts to protect public health. The impact on public health will persist until the ongoing outbreaks are controlled, vaccination coverage is high and immunity gaps in the population closed. The importation of cases to countries with suboptimal coverage and persisting population immunity gaps poses a high risk and may jeopardize the tremendous efforts invested to achieve elimination.",

2024-DON509,2024-DON509,2024-DON509,Assessment,"Overall, five countries in the WHO European region reported an unusual and unexpected increase in reports of cases of C. psittaci. &nbsp;Some of the reported cases developed pneumonia and resulted in hospitalization, and fatal cases were also reported. Sweden has reported a general increase in psittacosis cases since 2017, which could be associated with the increased use of more sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) panels. The increase in reported psittacosis cases across all countries requires additional investigation to determine whether it is a true increase in cases or an increase due to more sensitive surveillance or diagnostic techniques.While birds that carry this disease could be crossing international borders, there is currently no indication of this disease being spread by humans nationally or internationally. Generally, people do not spread the bacteria that causes psittacosis to other people, so there is a low likelihood of further human-to-human transmission of the disease. If correctly diagnosed, this pathogen is treatable by antibiotics. WHO continues to monitor the situation, and based on the available information, assesses the risk posed by this event as low.",

2024-DON508,2024-DON508,2024-DON508,Assessment,"WHO assesses the overall risk at the national level to be moderate due to following reasons:The case fatality rate from NiV infection is high. Initial signs and symptoms      of Nipah virus infection are non-specific, and the diagnosis is often not      suspected at the time of presentation.&nbsp;This can hinder accurate      diagnosis and creates challenges in outbreak detection, effective and      timely infection control measures, and outbreak response activities.There are currently no specific drugs or vaccines available for NiV infection      although WHO has identified Nipah as a priority disease for the WHO      Research and Development Blueprint.&nbsp; Intensive supportive care is      recommended to treat severe respiratory and neurologic complications.There is continued consumption of raw date palm sap by the community despite ongoing efforts for risk communication and community engagement to address food safety and risks to health.Despite these risk criteria, strong public health measures are in place to detect and control outbreaks including through the use of hospital-based systematic human NiV infection surveillance system which has been in place since 2006, and the utilization of the National Rapid Response Team (NRRT) at the central level and the Rapid Response Team (RRT) at the district level.WHO assesses the risk at the regional level to be moderate. Although Bangladesh borders India and Myanmar, currently affected districts do not share an international land border. While there have not been any instances of cross-border transmission previously, this risk remains given the shared ecological corridor for the virus natural host (Pteropus bats) and occurrence among domestic animals and humans previously in both Bangladesh and India. India, however, has experience of controlling previous outbreaks of NiV infection.&nbsp;WHO assesses the risk at the global level to be low, as there have been no previous confirmed cases outside Bangladesh, India, Malaysia, and Singapore.&nbsp; &nbsp;",
2024-DON506,2024-DON506,2024-DON506,Assessment,"The notification of these four cases does not change the overall risk assessment, with the risk being moderate at both the global and regional level. The four new cases reported between 13 August 2023 and 1 February 2024 are believed to have acquired MERS-CoV infection locally and not to have transmitted it further.&nbsp;WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East and/or other countries where MERS-CoV is circulating in dromedaries, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who were exposed to the virus through contact with&nbsp;dromedaries&nbsp;or their products (for example, consumption of raw camel milk), or in a health care setting.&nbsp;WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information.",
2024-DON504,2024-DON504,2024-DON504,Assessment,"Most human cases of infection with avian influenza viruses reported to date have been due to exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments. The first A(H10) subtype was isolated from chickens in Germany in 1949. Since then, A(H10) strains have occasionally been detected in wild waterfowl, domestic poultry, and mammals worldwide.&nbsp; As the A(H10) viruses are low pathogenic avian influenza viruses, it is not required to be reported to the World Organisation for Animal Health, and therefore, their true prevalence is unknown.In 2008, avian influenza A(H10N5) was isolated from swine in Hubei, China; however, the current H10N5 infection in a human in China is the first human case of avian influenza A(H10N5) detected globally.Due to limited data, further research is needed to determine the epidemiology of H10N5 viruses among animal populations to help inform surveillance efforts and preventive measures. Surveillance is important to monitor the spread of the virus, particularly in bird populations, considering the sporadic nature of human infections with other H10Nx subtypes such as H10N3.Currently available epidemiologic information suggests that avian influenza A(H10Nx) viruses have not acquired the capacity for sustained transmission among humans. Thus, the likelihood of human-to-human spread is considered low. Should infected individuals from affected areas travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during travel or after arrival. If this were to occur, further community-level spread is considered unlikely.&nbsp;",
2024-DON503,2024-DON503,2024-DON503,Assessment,"Most human cases with influenza A(H1N1)v virus infection result from exposure to swine influenza viruses through direct or indirect contact with infected swine or contaminated environments. However, some cases have been reported without an apparent source of exposure to swine in the weeks prior to illness onset. Because these viruses continue to be detected in swine populations worldwide, further human cases following direct or indirect contact with infected swine can be expected. Swine variant cases have been reported in recent years from many countries, including in Europe. Current evidence suggests that these viruses have not acquired the ability to sustain transmission among humans: there has been limited, non-sustained human-to-human transmission of variant influenza viruses, but ongoing community transmission has not been identified. The risk of detecting additional human cases associated with this event and further spread of the disease in humans is considered low. &nbsp;The risk assessment will be reviewed should further epidemiological or virological information become available.",
2024-DON505,2024-DON505,2024-DON505,Assessment,"In humans, the WEE virus can cause manifestations ranging from subclinical or moderate symptoms to severe forms of aseptic meningitis and encephalitis. Passerine birds are the main reservoir hosts for EEE and WEE viruses; however, in South America, other mammals, such as rodents and bats, may play a role as significant reservoirs of the virus, while equines and humans serve as terminal hosts (6)(7).The transmission of the WEE virus primarily occurs through the bite of infected mosquitoes acting as vectors. The main vectors are mosquitoes of the genera Culex, Culiseta and Aedes. These vectors maintain the circulation of the virus in wild enzootic cycles where birds act as the primary reservoirs. In the WEE outbreak in Argentina in 1983, the Aedes albifasciatus has been described as a potential vector of this virus (8). Humans and equines, acting as terminal hosts, do not contribute to the virus&rsquo;s ongoing transmission to mosquitoes (6). People who work outside or participate in outdoor activities are at greater risk because of mosquito exposure. Outbreaks of WEE in humans generally present as isolated cases with moderate symptoms; most infections are asymptomatic. Neurological manifestations include meningitis, encephalitis, or myelitis. As with other arboviral encephalitis, the one caused by WEE is characterized by fever, altered mental status, seizures, or focal neurological signs including movement disorders (9). It has been documented that mortality in humans ranges from 3% to 4% (6). There is no specific antiviral treatment, and care measures are supportive.",
2024-DON501,2024-DON501,2024-DON501,Assessment,"From 2003 to 28 January 2024, 884 human cases of influenza A (H5N1) infection, including 461 deaths, have been reported globally from 23 countries. Almost all cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H5N1) were sporadic infections and have been linked to close contact with infected live or dead birds, or influenza A(H5N1) contaminated environments. These animal influenza viruses do not easily infect humans, and human-to-human transmission appears to be unusual. However, severe disease with high mortality rates can occur as a result of human infection. Given that the virus continues to circulate in poultry, particularly in rural areas in Cambodia and other countries where the virus is endemic in poultry, the potential for further sporadic human cases can be expected.&nbsp;Available epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that A(H5N1) viruses have not acquired the ability to sustain transmission among humans. Therefore, the likelihood of human-to-human spread is considered low. Based on available information, WHO assesses the risk to the general population posed by this virus to be low.&nbsp;The risk assessment will be reviewed as needed if additional information becomes available.&nbsp;Close analysis of the epidemiological situation, further characterization of the most recent influenza A(H5N1) viruses in both human and poultry populations, and serological investigations, are critical to assess associated risks to public health and promptly adjust risk management measures.&nbsp;There are no specific vaccines for influenza A(H5N1) in humans. However, candidate vaccines to prevent influenza A(H5) infection in humans have been developed for pandemic preparedness in some countries. WHO continues to update the&nbsp;list&nbsp;of zoonotic influenza candidate vaccine viruses (CVV) twice a year at the WHO consultation on influenza virus vaccine composition. The list of such CVVs is available on WHO website. In addition, the genetic and antigenic characterizations of contemporary zoonotic influenza viruses are published&nbsp;on &nbsp;Global Influenza Programme (who.int). ",

Based on available information, WHO assesses the risk to the general population posed by this virus to be low.&nbsp;The risk assessment will be reviewed as needed if additional information becomes available.&nbsp;Close analysis of the epidemiological situation, further characterization of the most recent influenza A(H5N1) viruses in both human and poultry populations, and serological investigations, are critical to assess associated risks to public health and promptly adjust risk management measures.&nbsp;There are no specific vaccines for influenza A(H5N1) in humans. However, candidate vaccines to prevent influenza A(H5) infection in humans have been developed for pandemic preparedness in some countries. WHO continues to update the&nbsp;list&nbsp;of zoonotic influenza candidate vaccine viruses (CVV) twice a year at the WHO consultation on influenza virus vaccine composition. The list of such CVVs is available on WHO website. In addition, the genetic and antigenic characterizations of contemporary zoonotic influenza viruses are published&nbsp;on &nbsp;Global Influenza Programme (who.int). ",
2024-DON502,2024-DON502,2024-DON502,Assessment,"This is the first human infection with an influenza A(H1N1)v virus reported in Brazil in 2024. The patient had no history of exposure to pigs or any ill individuals. Based on currently available information, this represents a sporadic case and further spread has not been detected.Limited, non-sustained human-to-human transmission of variant influenza viruses has been described, although ongoing community transmission has never been identified. Current evidence suggests that these viruses have not acquired the ability to sustain transmission among humans.There is no vaccine for Influenza A(H1N1)v infection currently licensed for use in humans. Seasonal influenza vaccines against human influenza viruses are generally not expected to protect people from infection with influenza viruses that normally circulate in pigs, but they can reduce severity.WHO assesses the risk of international disease spread through humans and/or community-level spread among humans posed by this event as low. The risk assessment will be reviewed should further epidemiological or virological information become available.",
2024-DON500,2024-DON500,2024-DON500,Assessment,"The overall risk is assessed as high at the national level. The country has strong capacity to respond which was demonstrated during the Papua cVDPV1 and Aceh and West Java cVDPV2 outbreaks. However, the population is susceptible to type 2 polioviruses following both the switch from trivalent OPV (tOPV) to bivalent OPV (bOPV), and the sub-optimal IPV vaccination coverage in Central Java, East Java, neighbouring Yogyakarta and several other provinces of Indonesia. Vaccine hesitancy among some populations complicates vaccination activities. There is regular population movement from Central Java, East Java and the neighbouring populous region of Yogyakarta, to other provinces within the country and vice-versa. Central Java and East Java have moderate to strong capacity within existing resources for implementing response measures. At the regional level the overall risk is assessed to be moderate. Though there is no land-border from Central Java and East Java and limited cross-border population movement from the affected area, the virological analysis indicates that the virus may have been possibly circulating for some time and whole genome sequencing is still pending. This risk will be continuously assessed and will be reviewed according to the evolution of the situation.",
2023-DON499,2023-DON499,2023-DON499,Assessment,"The primary mode of WEE virus transmission is through the bites of infected mosquitoes, which act as vectors. The principal vector is Culex tarsalis; however, there are multiple vectors that contribute to transmission, including&nbsp;Aedes&nbsp;melanimon,&nbsp;Aedes&nbsp;dorsalis,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Aedes campestris.&nbsp;These vectors maintain the circulation of the virus in wild enzootic cycles where birds act as reservoirs of the virus. Humans and equines act as the final reservoirs of the virus, incapable of transmitting the virus to mosquitoes.5 People engaged in outside work or activities are at greater risk because of exposure to mosquitoes. Outbreaks of WEE in humans generally present as isolated cases with moderate symptoms and most infections are asymptomatic. Neurological manifestations include meningitis, encephalitis, or myelitis. Similar to other arboviral encephalitis, the encephalitis caused by WEE is characterized by fever accompanied by altered mental status, seizures, or focal neurological signs including movement disorders.6 There is no specific antiviral treatment and patient management primarily involves supportive care measures.&nbsp;",
2023-DON498,2023-DON498,2023-DON498,Assessment,"Recent data from 2023 emphasize escalated dengue outbreaks in several countries, particularly Bangladesh, Brazil, Burkina Faso, Fiji, Pakistan, the Philippines, and Viet Nam. Additionally, non-endemic countries are increasingly facing dengue as a significant public health concern. The emergence and re-emergence of dengue and its unprecedented worldwide spread are linked to various factors:  i) Changing distribution and adaptation of the Aedes aegypti vector; ii) increased unplanned urbanization and human activities fostering conducive environments for vector-host interaction; iii) Climate change-induced shifts in weather patterns; iv) Fragile healthcare systems amidst political and financial instabilities; v) Co-circulation of multiple dengue serotypes; vi) Challenges in clinical diagnosis due to non-specific symptoms; vii) Inadequate laboratory and testing capacity; viii) Prolonged ongoing concurrent outbreaks, including COVID-19; ix) Lack of specific treatment for dengue; x) Limited behavioral data available on community risk perceptions, awareness and health seeking behaviors: xi) Lack of community centered approach and RCCE resources to support engagement and mobilization of local communities in vector control activities; xi) Insufficient vector surveillance and control capacities and, xii) Lack of coordination among stakeholders, chronic underfunding,  low donor interest and xii) large scale movement of people and goods.  &nbsp;The expansion of DENV beyond its endemic transmission areas presents additional challenges.&nbsp; A significant population that is immunologically na&iuml;ve to the current virus circulating, increasing the risk of outbreaks. Moreover, people in these areas might lack awareness of dengue warning signs, leading to potential delays in seeking health care which is critical to reducing mortality from severe disease.  Accessibility challenges to medical facilities, compounded by limited geographical access, heighten the difficulty in accessing basic healthcare services.  These challenges are aggravated by stockouts of essential supplies for prevention and control, laboratory diagnostic reagents, and the need for ongoing training of healthcare workers. &nbsp;These factors, along with others, including financial crises, mass migration of internally displaced persons (IDPs) and refugees, and longstanding developmental inadequacies, have deprived large populations across all continents of adequate healthcare, consequently increasing their vulnerability to dengue. However, it is important to note that the distribution of dengue risk varies significantly across regions, countries, and within countries.  &nbsp;Based on all the above WHO has assessed the risk at global level as high. Following the risk assessment and an internal grading process, WHO Regional Offices have agreed on priority interventions to implement in support of Member States.&nbsp;Dengue prevention and outbreak response involves several agencies in the public health sector. Addressing these challenges requires a multidisciplinary and multisectoral integrated approach, especially at national level to achieve its goal of reducing the impact on public health. The strain on epidemic response capacity due to simultaneous concurrent outbreaks coupled with political crises highlights the need for robust emergency response mechanisms and strengthened collaboration among stakeholders. The global lack of resources, including shortages of good quality dengue diagnostic kits for early detection, lack of trained clinical and vector control personnel, and community awareness remain a critical obstacle to an effective response. While coordination efforts with global health organizations like WHO and other partners strive to set common priorities and analyses, the need for continuous support to affected countries and enhanced collaboration is imperative. &nbsp;",
2023-DON497,2023-DON497,2023-DON497,Assessment,"Anthrax is endemic in Zambia, usually occurring between May and January, with a peak toward the end of the dry season (between October and November). Although sporadic cases are reported yearly in animals and humans across the country, a large-scale outbreak like the current one has not been reported since 2011, when there were 511 suspected human cases.The epidemic is spreading along the provinces located along the basin of the Zambezi, Kafue, and Luangwa rivers, which is an additional problem because these rivers also flow into Lake Kariba in Zimbabwe, Kahora Bassa in Mozambique and Lake Malawi, and the risk of anthrax transmission to neighbouring countries is increased.Other affected districts and provinces of Zambia have reported sporadic suspected cases and deaths since June 2023. In addition, the Bacillus anthracis bacteria can form highly resistant spores that survive in the environment for decades The risk for human health is high given the known population&rsquo;s multiple exposures from handling the carcasses of animals that had died suddenly and eating meat from infected animals with resultant associated cutaneous and gastrointestinal anthrax. The risk of the event spreading within Zambia has increased due to the unrestricted animal movement and carcasses within and between provinces. Since September 2023, there has been a significant rise in the number of affected districts. Moreover, a low index of suspicion, socio-cultural norms, community resistance, limited community knowledge regarding anthrax transmission, high levels of poverty and food insecurity, a shortage of available vaccines and laboratory reagents, inadequate carcass disposal and decontamination practices significantly contribute to hampering the containment of the anthrax outbreak. There is an absence of robust engagement with local communities involved in breeding and handling cattle and livestock, including farmers, heads of cattle markets, and butchers. Among these communities, the fear of losing livelihoods often outweighs concerns about contracting anthrax. The risk of insufficient control capacities is considered high in Zambia due to concurrent public health emergencies in the country (cholera, measles, COVID-19) that limit the country&rsquo;s human and financial capacities to respond to the current anthrax outbreak adequately.The risk at the regional level is also considered high due to the frequent movement of both animals and people between Zambia and its neighbouring countries (such as Angola, Botswana, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Tanzania, Uganda and Zimbabwe). This is compounded by the confirmed cases of anthrax spreading in provinces located along the basin of the Zambezi, Kafue, and Luangwa rivers. These rivers ultimately flow into Lake Kariba in Zimbabwe, the Kahora Bassa lake in Mozambique, and Lake Malawi. Unburied carcasses of wild animals that float on the river increase the risk of international spread to neighbouring countries. They can spread the bacterium and infections to other regions, including neighbouring countries, and be eaten by other animals, which can further perpetuate the spread.",
2023-DON496,2023-DON496,2023-DON496,Assessment,"Influenza viruses circulate in swine populations in many regions of the world. Depending on geographic location, the genetic characteristics of these viruses differ. Most human cases result from exposure to swine influenza viruses through contact with infected swine or contaminated environments, although some cases have been reported without an apparent source of exposure to swine in the weeks prior to illness onset. Because these viruses continue to be detected in swine populations worldwide, further human cases following direct or indirect contact with infected swine can be expected.&nbsp;Current evidence suggests that these viruses have not acquired the ability to sustain transmission among humans. There has been limited, non-sustained human-to-human transmission of variant influenza viruses, although ongoing community transmission has not been identified.&nbsp;This is the first swine influenza A(H1N2)v case reported in the United Kingdom. There is no clear indication of direct contact with pigs or any ill individuals.&nbsp; Though the source of infection is unknown at this time, the virus is closely aligned to that circulating in the swine population in the United Kingdom. Several previous variant cases have also not had clear exposure histories to swine and there was no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission in these cases. Limited human-to-human transmission may have played a role, but there is no definitive evidence.&nbsp;Further virus characterization is ongoing. National routine surveillance indicators do not show any unusual increases in respiratory illness in the local population. The risk of there being additional human cases associated with this event appears to be low &ndash; though the possibility of limited person-to-person transmission cannot be excluded at this stage.&nbsp;The risk assessment will be reviewed should further epidemiological or virological information become available.",
2023-DON495,2023-DON495,2023-DON495,Assessment,"From 2003 to 27 November 2023, a total of 882 human cases of infection with influenza A(H5N1), including 461 deaths, have been reported globally from 23 countries. Almost all cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H5N1) have been linked to close contact with infected live or dead birds, or influenza A(H5N1)-contaminated environments. Based on evidence so far, the virus does not infect humans easily and spread from person-to-person appears to be unusual. Human infection can cause severe disease and has a high mortality rate. Since the virus continues to circulate in poultry, particularly in rural areas in Cambodia, the potential for further sporadic human cases can be expected. In these two cases, while human-to-human transmission cannot be ruled out, it is likely there were separate exposures to the viruses from sick and dead chickens. In the past, small clusters of A(H5) virus infections were reported, including those involving health care workers, but without evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission. Available epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that A(H5N1) viruses have not acquired the ability to sustain transmission among humans. Therefore, the likelihood of sustained human-to-human spread is low. Based on available information so far, WHO assesses the risk to the general population posed by this virus to be low.&nbsp;The risk assessment will be reviewed as needed if additional information becomes available.&nbsp; Close analysis of the epidemiological situation, further characterization of the most recent influenza A(H5N1) viruses in both human and poultry populations, and serological investigations are critical to assess associated risks to public health and promptly adjust risk management measures.

2023-DON494,2023-DON494,2023-DON494,Assessment,"In the current outbreak of respiratory illness, the reported symptoms are common to several respiratory diseases and, as of now, at the present time, Chinese surveillance and hospital systems report that the clinical manifestations are caused by known pathogens in circulation. Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a common respiratory pathogen and a common cause of paediatric pneumonia, and is readily treated with antibiotics.China has an influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) sentinel surveillance system. Since mid-October, China has implemented enhanced surveillance systems for respiratory illness covering a broad spectrum of respiratory viruses and bacteria, including Mycoplasma pneumoniae.There is limited detailed information available to fully characterize the overall risk of these reported cases of respiratory illness in children. However, due to the arrival of the winter season, the increasing trend in respiratory illnesses is expected; co-circulation of respiratory viruses may increase burden on health care facilities.According to surveillance data reported to WHO&rsquo;s FluNet and published by the National Influenza Centre in China, ILI was above usual levels for this time of year and increasing in the northern provinces. Influenza detections were predominantly A(H3N2) and B/Victoria lineage viruses.",
2023-DON493,2023-DON493,2023-DON493,Assessment,"From 1 January to 12 November 2023, there has been a two-fold increase in the number of suspected mpox cases with 12 569 suspected cases reported, compared to 6216 in 2020, the highest annual number previously reported. Mpox has also been reported in new geographic areas such as Kinshasa, Kwango province and South Kivu. The reasons for this expansion, affecting men, women and children, remain unknown. Although increased awareness of the global mpox epidemic due to clade IIb MPXV has helped improve surveillance in the country, many aspects of the current situation remain to be elucidated.&nbsp;Transmission of mpox through sexual contact enables faster spread from one person to another due to direct contact of mucous membranes, possibly leading to a shorter average incubation period. Immunocompromised individuals, either due to uncontrolled HIV or other immunocompromising conditions, are at higher risk for severe mpox complications and mpox-related death. &nbsp;While national HIV prevalence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is estimated to be &lt;1%, it is estimated to be 7.1% among men who have sex with men. Overall, an estimated 17% of people living with HIV in the country do not know their status, putting them at risk of developing advanced HIV infection, compromised immunity, and severe mpox disease. The detection of clade I MPXV among visitors to a club of men who have sex with men in Kenge, some of whose members travel to visit other clubs within and outside the country, particularly in central Africa and in Europe, represents a risk for men who have sex with men in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and internationally. In the city of Kinshasa, it is estimated that there are over 50 similar clubs, and some of their members reside outside the Democratic Republic of the Congo.&nbsp;It is still unclear what proportion of mpox cases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo may be exposed through sexual contact; however, with outbreaks linked to sexual transmission documented in 2023 in three previously unaffected provinces, the potential additional public health impact of this new observation could be significant, particularly in under-resourced urban areas. The rapid evolution of the new outbreak in South Kivu, including among sex workers, is also concerning.Additionally, the first case identified in Kinshasa had traveled to the city by boat on the Congo river. These boats constitute a potentially high exposure environment since people are often in proximity, transporting animals, selling and consuming wild game on board, and often traveling on the boats for weeks while sharing beds and sometimes engaging in sexual activities.&nbsp;Moreover, the human-to-human spread potential is amplified in urban settings such as Kinshasa and the implementation of containment measures is more challenging.Response capacities for mpox remain limited in the country. Surveillance and laboratory capacities remain suboptimal: only 9% (1106 / 12 569, as of week 44) of suspected cases this year have been tested by PCR. There are no immunization programmes for populations at risk of mpox in the Democratic Republic of the Congo outside of research projects, and access to the antiviral medication tecovirimat also remains limited to a few clinical research studies in the country. Risk communication and community engagement are therefore of critical importance to address the risk posed by modes of transmission traditionally reported as bushmeat consumption and community outbreaks, as well as for the newly described risk of sexual transmission, particularly among men who have sex with men. According to a recent WHO study, awareness of the risks associated with mpox is low in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.&nbsp;Additionally, anyone suffering from disfiguring skin conditions, including due to mpox, may face stigma, and the lack of health messages to date for men who have sex with men in the country exposes this population to a particular risk.&nbsp;In summary, the reasons for concern about further spread of mpox in the Democratic Republic of the Congo are as follows: The Democratic Republic of the Congo is experiencing a significant increase in the number of suspected cases reported in 2023; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Geographic expansion of the presence of mpox is underway in the newly affected southern and eastern provinces of the country; Epidemiological and scientific knowledge about mpox remains limited and modes of transmission in the country are poorly understood;In 2023, confirmed cases of mpox have been reported in the large urban area of ​​Kinshasa and several other previously unaffected areas for the first time;Sexual transmission of mpox due to clade I MPXV is being documented for the first time and chains of transmission may have been missed;Key populations experience a higher prevalence of HIV infection than the general population;Awareness of mpox and the associated risks are insufficient in the general and key populations;National response capacities face challenges, including limited epidemiological information on exposure and infection risk factors, limited public awareness of mpox and prevention measures, and numerous competing priorities;Collaboration and coordination among partners are needed to sustain essential research and support a robust response at national as well as provincial and local levels.&nbsp;The risk of mpox further spreading to neighbouring countries and worldwide appears to be significant. In addition to the features outlined above, arguments supporting the assessment of a high risk of international spread of mpox include the following:&nbsp;These first reported outbreaks of mpox due to clade I MPXV linked to sexual contact include a history of international travel within and across WHO regions;The introduction of clade I MPXV in different and possibly intersecting sexual networks could facilitate and amplify the spread of this historically more virulent clade of the virus;A concurrent outbreak of mpox is occurring in the neighbouring Republic of Congo along the Congo River ecosystem, whose links, if any, with cases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo remain unknown.These factors pose an additional risk of mpox outbreaks with potentially more severe consequences than the one which has been affecting the world since 2022.&nbsp;",
2023-DON492,2023-DON492,2023-DON492,Assessment,"Diphtheria is a vaccine-preventable disease caused by exotoxin-producing Corynebacterium diphtheriae, transmitted from person to person through close physical and respiratory contact. It can cause infection of the nasopharynx, which may lead to breathing difficulties and death. Diphtheria is fatal in 5 - 10% of cases, with a higher mortality rate in young children. Treatment involves administering diphtheria antitoxin as well as antibiotics. Vaccination against diphtheria has reduced the mortality and morbidity of diphtheria dramatically.The DAT supply is currently very constrained and insufficient to respond to current demands, as there is only a limited number of manufacturers and large outbreaks are being reported in different regions of the world.The risk of diphtheria in Guinea is considered high due to the low DTP3 vaccination coverage in the affected region (36% according to the survey coverage in households, 2023) and 47% national DTP3 vaccination coverage between 2014-2022 (per WHO/UNICEF estimates), and the risk at the regional level is moderate and low at the global level. The outbreak is also characterized by high case fatality among confirmed cases. Other factors include: the over population of the Siguiri health district, which is the epicenter of this outbreak, the weakened healthcare system and several concurrent epidemics in the area. The overpopulation of the Siguiri health prefecture, the epicenter of this epidemic, the insufficient poorly qualified health personnel, and the limited material resources of the health system weakens the response to this outbreak. In addition, the country is facing several concurrent epidemics in the area, such as pertussis, poliomyelitis, and rabies. Adding this to a context of extreme vulnerability due to mining activities, which induce significant population movement, reduce air quality, and increase the risk of natural disasters such as floods and landslides, impacting people&rsquo;s health.This emphasizes the urgent need to strengthen diphtheria vaccination coverage nationwide, especially in the epicenter and strengthen case management at hospital facilities dealing with diphtheria cases.",
2023-DON491,2023-DON491,2023-DON491,Assessment,"This is the first dengue outbreak reported in Chad, and the country lacks the necessary public health preparedness and response capacities.Community cases are likely underreported because dengue is unknown to the general public and clinicians are not yet sensitised to its presentation, which is sometimes confused with those of other common febrile infections, making early diagnosis challenging, particularly in settings with lack of laboratory facilities for testing.There is a high risk of spread due to the presence of mosquitoes in large, densely populated cities in eastern Chad near the Sudan border, with a tropical climate, and poor sanitation conditions suitable for mosquito development.The province of Ouadda&iuml;, which borders Sudan, is the epicentre of the outbreak and is also the province most affected by the ongoing humanitarian crisis due to a massive influx of refugees and returnees from Sudan. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the number of refugees in the Ouadda&iuml; province is currently more than 400 000.The movement of returning Sudanese refugees and Chadian nationals has the potential to spread the outbreak to new provinces and across the border.Based on the information available for this event, WHO assesses the risk posed by this outbreak as high at the national level, moderate at regional level, and low at global level.",

2023-DON488,2023-DON488,2023-DON488,Assessment,"Although no epidemiological baseline data is available for previous years, the high number of suspected cases and deaths of suspected typhoid fever and Shigella reported within two months, led to an overflow of health facilities as well as the high number of patients reported that have undergone surgical intervention due to intestinal perforation, are considered unusual.Although sporadic cholera outbreaks have been reported in the Republic of Congo, the city of Dolisie, the current epicentre, has not previously recorded such an outbreak. Cholera outbreaks are ongoing in the neighbouring countries of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Cameroon, but no epidemiolocal link has been identified. So far, no disease spread to other countries has been reported linked to this outbreak. WHO assesses the risk at the national level as high. This is based on the rapid outbreak dynamic and high morbidity and mortality of this outbreak, the strain on the health care system and high risk of healthcare&ndash;associated infections, the limited access to safe drinking water in Dolisie, the poor water and sanitation infrastructure, poor hygiene practices, and the observed limitations in the rapid detection, confirmation, and management of suspected cases.

However, given the ranging incubation period of botulism&mdash;up to eight days&mdash;and that not all customers of the restaurant in Bordeaux may have been identified despite efforts, further cases linked to this event may still occur. This outbreak has occurred at the same time as the Rugby World Cup held from the week of 4 September 2023 attracting followers and rugby teams from all over the world.&nbsp;Due to the incubation period up to eight days and the restaurant attracting international visitors, there is a possibility that additional cases among international visitors may be reported either from France or outside of France until 18 September.",
2023-DON487,2023-DON487,2023-DON487,Assessment,"Legionellosis varies in severity from a mild febrile illness to a severe and sometimes fatal form of pneumonia and is caused by exposure to&nbsp;Legionella&nbsp;species found in contaminated water and potting mixes. Outbreaks of Legionella have been linked to poorly maintained water systems, particularly cooling towers or evaporative condensers associated with air conditioning and industrial cooling, hot and cold-water systems in public and private buildings, and whirlpool spas.Infection can also occur by aspiration of contaminated water or ice, particularly in susceptible hospital patients. To date, there is no reported human-to-human transmission. Legionnaires' disease requires treatment with antibiotics, and currently, no vaccine is available for Legionnaires' disease.Sporadic outbreaks of Legionnaires' disease have been reported previously in Poland. Between 2017 and 2021, Poland reported between 38 to 74 cases of Legionnaires&rsquo; disease annually to the European Surveillance System (TESSy). In 2022, this increased to 111 reported cases.Robust surveillance and response activities are being implemented during the current outbreak, and case numbers have been reduced. Nonetheless, without an identified source of&nbsp;Legionella&nbsp;bacteria, there is a continued risk of developing Legionellosis for people working or living in the affected areas. Older adults, smokers, and people with weakened immune systems are particularly susceptible to the disease.Travel-associated Legionnaires&rsquo; disease (TALD) is a frequent phenomenon, with, on average, about 20% of the cases of legionellosis detected in Europe considered to be travel-associated. The outbreak is reported in the south-eastern city of Rzesz&oacute;w, the main hub for humanitarian aid for Ukraine and the transit hub for international military support for Ukraine; therefore, TALD may be expected in people visiting Rzesz&oacute;w.According to the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), in 2021, the EU/EEA witnessed the highest annual notification rate of Legionnaires&rsquo; disease, with 2.4 cases per 100 000 population. The cause of the increased reported incidence observed during that period in Europe remains unclear. Legionnaires&rsquo; disease is a notifiable disease in the EU, and the events are closely followed up through ECDC and European Legionnaires&rsquo; Disease Surveillance Network (ELDSNet).",
2023-DON485,2023-DON485,2023-DON485,Assessment,"Diphtheria is a vaccine-preventable disease caused mainly by exotoxin-producing Corynebacterium diphtheriae but also by Corynebacterium ulcerans.&nbsp; Diphtheria is fatal in 5 - 10% of cases, with a higher mortality rate in young children. Treatment involves administering DAT as well as antibiotics. Vaccination against diphtheria reduces the mortality and morbidity of diphtheria dramatically.Nigeria is currently facing a second wave of a diphtheria outbreak after a first wave of the outbreak was recorded between epidemiological week 52, 2022 (1 January 2023) and week 20, 2023 (22 May 2023). There is an increase in the affected population with a rise in the number of confirmed cases and related deaths reported in epidemiological weeks 31-33. There is an increased risk of transmission, with clusters and outbreaks reported in newly affected LGAs, with currently 27 LGAs reporting one clinically compatible case in the last three reporting weeks relative to 15 LGAs that had active case in the preceding three weeks.The low national coverage (57%) of the Pentavalent vaccine (Penta 3) administered in routine immunization, and the suboptimal vaccination coverage in the pediatric population&mdash;with 43% of the target population unvaccinated&mdash;underscores the risk of further spread and the accumulation of a critical mass of susceptible population in the country with sub-optimal herd or population immunity. Vaccine coverage of 80&ndash;85% must be maintained to ensure community protection.This emphasizes the urgent need to strengthen diphtheria vaccination coverage nationwide, especially in the most affected states, such as Kano. Additionally, particular attention is necessary for regions experiencing insecurity challenges, like the Northwest, as it hampers vaccine accessibility. Due to insecurity, especially in Northeast Nigeria, vaccination coverage remains suboptimal.DAT supply is currently very constrained and insufficient to respond to current demands, as there is only a limited number of manufacturers and large outbreaks are being reported in different regions of the world. &nbsp;The NCDC, with support from WHO and other partners have procured 10 050 DAT vials for case management in response to the outbreak.Diphtheria outbreaks are underreported in Nigeria. According to the 2021 Nigeria Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey and National Immunization Coverage Survey, the third dose of pentavalent vaccine (Penta3) coverage was 57% in 2021.WHO second Rapid Risk Assessment for diphtheria in Nigeria reassessed and maintained the risk as high at the national level and low at the regional and global levels.",

There has been one large outbreak outside of the Middle East, in the Republic of Korea, in May 2015, during which 186 laboratory-confirmed cases (185 in the Republic of Korea and 1 in China) and 38 deaths were reported. The index case in that outbreak had a travel history to the Middle East. The global number reflects the total number of laboratory-confirmed cases reported to WHO under IHR (2005) or directly by Ministries of Health. The total number of deaths includes the deaths that WHO is aware of to date through follow-up with affected Member States.&nbsp;WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East and/or other countries where MERS-CoV is circulating in dromedaries, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who were exposed to the virus through contact with&nbsp;dromedaries&nbsp;or their products (for example, consumption of raw camel milk), or in a healthcare setting. WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information.&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of MERS cases reported to WHO has substantially declined since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. This is likely the result of epidemiological surveillance activities for COVID-19 being prioritized and the similar clinical picture of both diseases, resulting in reduced testing and detection of MERS CoV cases. The Ministry of Health of KSA is working to improve testing capacities for better detection of MERS-CoV during the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;In addition, measures taken during the COVID-19 pandemic to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission (e.g., mask wearing, hand hygiene, physical distancing, improving ventilation of indoor spaces, respiratory etiquette, stay-at-home orders, reduced mobility) also likely reduced opportunities for onward human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV.",
2023-DON483,2023-DON483,2023-DON483,Assessment,"Measles remains one of the leading causes of death among young children worldwide. It is highly contagious, with 90% of non-immune people exposed to an infectious individual estimated to contract the disease. &nbsp;In 2016, the Region of the Americas was the first Region of WHO to be declared free of endemic transmission of measles viruses by the International Expert Committee (IEC) for&nbsp;Documenting and Verifying Measles, Rubella and the Congenital Rubella Syndrome in the Americas.&nbsp;Nevertheless, maintaining the Region free of measles is an ongoing challenge due to the permanent risk of importation and reintroduction of the virus. This case corresponds to a susceptible cohort of people born between 1971 and 1981 who were not immunized with two doses of MMR or did not previously present with the disease.During the COVID-19 pandemic, there might be a risk of disruption to routine immunization activities due to both COVID-19 related burden on the health system and decreased demand for vaccination because of physical distancing requirements or community reluctance. Disruption of immunization services even for a short time can result in increased numbers of susceptible individuals and raise the likelihood of outbreak-prone vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs) such as measles.",
2023-DON482,2023-DON482,2023-DON482,Assessment,"Swine influenza A viruses circulate in swine populations in many regions of the world. Depending on geographic location, the genetic characteristics of these viruses differ. When an influenza A virus that normally circulates in swine (but not people) is detected in a person, it is called a &ldquo;variant influenza virus&rdquo;. Most human cases are the result of exposure to swine influenza A viruses through contact with infected swine or contaminated environments. Because these viruses continue to be detected in swine populations around the world, further human cases can be expected.According to the IHR, a human infection caused by a novel influenza A virus subtype is an event that has the potential for high public health impact. A novel influenza A virus is considered to have the potential to cause a pandemic if (1) the virus has demonstrated the capacity to infect and transmit efficiently among humans, and (2) differs from currently circulating seasonal human influenza viruses (i.e., A/H1 or A/H3), circulating widely in the human population such that the hemagglutinin (HA) gene (or protein) is not a mutated form of those; and (3) the population has little to no immunity against it. To date, only sporadic human infections caused by influenza A(H3N2), A(H1N1) and A(H1N2) variant viruses have been reported in the United States, and there has been no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission. Human infections with influenza variant viruses tend to result in mild clinical illness, although some cases have been hospitalized with more severe disease. Given the potential impact on public health, human infections with these viruses need to be monitored closely. In this event, there was no reported evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission, the illness was mild and no further influenza variant virus transmission in the community has been identified. There has been some limited, non-sustained human-to-human transmission of variant influenza A viruses, although ongoing community transmission has not been identified. Current evidence suggests that these viruses have not acquired the ability of sustained transmission among humans. The risk assessment will be reviewed if needed should further epidemiological or virological information become available. Influenza A viruses that infect pigs are different from human influenza A viruses. Currently, there is no vaccine for Influenza A(H1N2)v infection licensed for use in humans. Thus, influenza vaccines against human influenza viruses are generally not expected to protect people from influenza viruses that normally circulate in pigs. ",
2023-DON481,2023-DON481,2023-DON481,Assessment,"Dengue is endemic in Bangladesh&nbsp;with recurrent outbreaks and is one of the major public health concerns in Bangladesh.&nbsp;Dengue virus has the potential to cause epidemics resulting in high morbidity and mortality. All four serotypes of the dengue virus have been reported in Bangladesh with the predominance of DENV 1 and DENV2 until 2016. Since 2019, when the largest dengue outbreak was reported, DENV3 has been the predominant serotype, while this year DENV2 has become the predominant serotype.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no specific treatment for cases and clinical management is based on supportive therapy however, the early&nbsp;detection of infection and appropriate clinical management of patients can reduce the severity of disease and mortality The prevention and control of dengue depends on vector control.&nbsp;A dengue&nbsp;vaccine has not been approved in Bangladesh. The&nbsp;dengue risk at the national level is assessed as &lsquo;High&rsquo; due to the ongoing rapidly increasing number of cases and deaths with the peak not yet reached, the high CFR compared to the previous years and the increasing geographical distribution of cases. In addition, DENV2 has been identified as the predominant circulating serotype, following four years of DENV3 predominating which may result in higher numbers of severe cases as a result of a second infection with a heterologous serotype. Furthermore, there is some pressure on the healthcare capacity due to the very high number of admissions for dengue; high vector density; and an anticipated prolonged monsoon.Bangladesh has three international airports, three seaports and twenty-three land ports. Bangladesh shares 94% of its land border with India with frequent population movement across the land crossing, however, dengue is already endemic in India including the eastern Indian states which share land borders with Bangladesh and where Aedes mosquitoes breed and circulate. Climate change along with heavy rains in neighboring countries increase the likelihood of vector-borne disease transmission. Due to social and economic factors, many people migrate from Bangladesh to other countries thereby increasing the risk of international disease spread. Bangladesh receives a large volume of international tourists, and the possibility of travellers acquiring the disease and contributing to its further spread outside the country cannot be ruled out.&nbsp;",
2023-DON479,2023-DON479,2023-DON479,Assessment,"The MoH established the Kenya Expanded Programme on Immunization (KEPI) for six priority diseases including polio in 1980.Inactivated polio vaccine was introduced in 2015. Although the country did not have a wild poliovirus outbreak in 2014, Kenya, together with other Horn of African countries remained at risk of imported wild poliovirus from neighbouring Somalia due to the 2013 outbreak that continued until July 2014.&nbsp; After this polio outbreak in 2013, the country initiated environmental surveillance for polioviruses in an effort to supplement AFP surveillance, which is the benchmark for surveillance of wild poliovirus. WHO assesses the overall risk at the national level to be high due to the overcrowded living conditions in the refugee camp, high rate of malnutrition, poor water and sanitation facilities, mass and frequent population movements with Somalia, influx of new arrivals to the camp, late identification of the newly arrived children, high prevalence of zero dose children among the newly arriving children from middle and lower Juba Somalia, and sub-optimal surveillance performance. WHO considers the risk of international spread and/or emergence of cVDPV2 of this strain to be high, particularly across other areas of the Horn of Africa, due to the low population immunity, the use of trivalent OPV (tOPV) in Somalia, suboptimal surveillance, and inadequate routine immunization levels in some areas, and large-scale population movements. In all instances, the continued spread of existing outbreaks including the genetically linked cVDPV2 cases detected in Kenya which is genetically linked to the one circulating in Somalia as well as the emergence of new outbreaks of cVDPV2 indicates significant gaps in routine immunization coverage and inadequate outbreak response vaccination. The risk of further spread of such strains, or the emergence of new strains, is exacerbated by decreased immunization rates related to disruption in routine and campaign immunization during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
2023-DON480,2023-DON480,2023-DON480,Assessment,"WHO assesses the overall risk at the national level to be high due to the sub-optimal AFP surveillance performance in some districts, the sub-optimal vaccination coverage resulting in low population immunity and more susceptible children, and the ongoing population movement across neighbouring countries.WHO considers this event to be of high risk of international spread and/or emergence of cVDPV2 of this strain across the region, particularly across other areas of central and south-east Africa, due to the low population immunity and inadequate routine immunization levels in some areas, and large-scale population movements. In all instances, the continued spread of existing outbreaks as well as the emergence of new outbreaks of cVDPV2 point to gaps in routine immunization coverage and inadequate outbreak response vaccination. While new WHO and UNICEF data show promising signs of immunization services rebounding in some countries, coverage still falls short of pre-pandemic levels putting children at risk from disease outbreaks, particularly in low-income countries.&nbsp; In response to these latest published data, the members of the Immunization Agenda 2030 Partnership Council called for further strengthened efforts (Immunization Agenda 2030) for immunization recovery.",
2023-DON477,2023-DON477,2023-DON477,Assessment,"Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome is a rare condition, and while it is more common in adults and males, people of all ages can be affected. The cause of it is not fully understood, but most cases follow an infection with a virus or bacteria. This leads the immune system to attack the body itself. Infection with the bacteria Campylobacter jejuni, which causes gastroenteritis, is one of the most common risk factors for GBS. People can also develop GBS after having the flu or other viral infections, including cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and the Zika virus. In rare instances, vaccinations may increase the risk of people getting GBS, but the likelihood of this occurring is extremely low. Studies show that people are much more likely to get GBS from infections such as the flu than from the vaccine given to prevent the infection, in this case, the flu vaccine. Occasionally, surgery can trigger GBS.To date, the potential cause of the reported increase in GBS incidence in Peru remains under investigation as Campylobacter jejuni infection was confirmed by the laboratory in 63% of GBS cases from 22 samples tested since epidemiological week 23. In 2019, Peru reported an unprecedented outbreak of Guillain-Barr&eacute; Syndrome that affected several regions of the country, which was concluded to be associated with the presence of the Campylobacter jejuni ST2993 genotype. Further investigations are needed to identify the possible causes associated with the increase. So far, no association has been found with the current dengue outbreak, and Zika virus transmission is currently low in the country. Additionally, there have been no reports of a similar surge in cases in other countries of the Americas.",
2023-DON478,2023-DON478,2023-DON478,Assessment,"Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) is a viral respiratory infection of humans and dromedary camels which is caused by a coronavirus called the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Infection with MERS-CoV can cause severe disease in humans resulting in high mortality. Approximately 35% of patients with MERS-CoV have died, but this may be an overestimate of the true mortality rate, as mild cases of MERS-CoV may be missed by existing surveillance systems. Until more is known about the disease, the case fatality rates are counted only amongst the laboratory-confirmed cases reported to WHO. Humans are infected with MERS-CoV from direct or indirect contact with dromedaries, a host and zoonotic source of MERS-CoV infection. MERS-CoV has demonstrated the ability to be transmitted between humans. So far, the observed non-sustained human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts and in healthcare settings.&nbsp;Outside of the healthcare setting, there has been limited human-to-human transmission. Cases of MERS-CoV infection are rare in the UAE. Since July 2013, a total of 94 MERS-CoV cases, including this current case, resulting in 12 deaths (CFR 13%) have been reported to WHO from the UAE.Globally, the total number of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases reported to WHO since 2012 is 2605, including 936 associated deaths as of July 2023. The majority of the reported cases have occurred in countries in the Arabian Peninsula. Outside of this region, there has been one large outbreak in the Republic of Korea, in May 2015, during which 186 laboratory-confirmed cases (185 in the Republic of Korea and one in China) and 38 deaths were reported. The global number reflects the total number of laboratory-confirmed cases and deaths reported to WHO under IHR (2005) to date.The notification of this case does not change the overall risk assessment. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East and/or other countries where MERS-CoV is circulating in dromedaries, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who were exposed to the virus through contact with dromedaries or their products (for example, consumption of camel&rsquo;s raw milk), or in a healthcare setting. WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessments based on the latest available information.&nbsp;",
2023-DON475,2023-DON475,2023-DON475,Assessment,"Dengue is a mosquito - borne viral disease (arbovirus) that has the potential to cause serious public health impact. The virus that causes this infection has been circulating in the region of the Americas for decades10&nbsp;due to the widespread distribution of the&nbsp;Aedes&nbsp;spp. mosquitoes (mainly&nbsp;Aedes aegypti), with epidemics occurring cyclically every 3 to 5 years. Several dengue outbreaks have been documented previously in the Region. This arbovirus can be carried by infected travellers (imported cases) and may establish new areas of local transmission in the presence of vectors and a susceptible population. As they are arboviruses, all populations living in areas with the presence of&nbsp;Aedes aegypti&nbsp;are at risk, however, their impact largely affects the most vulnerable people, in which the arboviral disease programs do not have enough resources to respond to outbreaks.The consequences of the current high transmission scenario depend on several factors, including the current capacities for a coordinated public health response and clinical management, the early start of the arbovirus season in the southern hemisphere, high mosquito densities and the possible impact of climate change and El Nino phenomenon in the southern hemisphere, lack of vector surveillance and control activities during the COVID-19 pandemic and high proportion of the susceptible population for arboviruses in the region. The current high transmission scenario for dengue occurs in the context of other ongoing outbreaks and emergencies. The synergic effects of concurrent emergencies may hinder the health system&rsquo;s capacity to respond to an epidemic of arboviral diseases and therefore affect disease control and proper clinical management, including, but not limited to (i) misdiagnosis, given that &nbsp;dengue symptoms may be non-specific and resemble other infections, including chikungunya, Zika and measles, potentially leading to inadequate case management;&nbsp; (ii) overwhelmed healthcare facilities in some areas given high caseload, as well as other concurrent outbreaks of other communicable diseases; and (iii) the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the decrease of available resources to arboviral disease programs and the need for capacity building and training of vector-control and healthcare workers, as well as maintenance and procurement of equipment and insecticides to perform vector control activities.Dengue is endemic in most countries of South America. However, during the seasonal period in the first half of 2023, where dengue outbreaks have been detected, there has been an increase in the number of cases at levels above the average number of cases recorded in the last five years and the expansion of dengue out of historical areas of transmission.Aedes&nbsp;spp. mosquitoes are widely distributed in the Region of the Americas, therefore, dengue international spread is likely. Additionally, it is expected that in the second half of 2023, some countries in the Region, especially in Central America and the Caribbean, will have an increase in rainfall, which, depending on its magnitude and impact on dengue-endemic areas, could increase the incidence of the disease and constitute an additional burden of arboviral diseases for health systems in affected areas.The risk at the regional level is assessed as high due to the widely spread distribution of the vector (especially&nbsp;Aedes aegypti), the continued risk of severe disease and even death, and the expansion out of historical areas of transmission, where all the population, including risk groups and healthcare workers, may not be aware of warning signs.Information on the circulating dengue virus serotype is limited. It is expected that a large proportion of the population in these areas is na&iuml;ve to the current virus circulating, which may lead to outbreaks. Moreover, people in these areas may not be aware of warning signs, and the population might delay seeking health care.In some areas, there is a lack of medical facilities with limited geographical access, making it difficult for people to access basic health care. Especially in these areas, people tend to self-medicate, and in dengue cases ibuprofen, acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are contraindicated because they can aggravate gastritis or bleeding and lead to increased mortality risk. &nbsp;Other challenges reported by Member States in the Region include but are not limited to stockouts of several essential supplies for prevention and control, lack of reagents and consumables for laboratory diagnosis, and the need for re-training field teams and health workers. In addition, higher transmission rates are expected in the following months due to favourable weather conditions to vector activity in the second half of the year in Central America and the northern hemisphere.",
2023-DON476,2023-DON476,2023-DON476,Assessment,"To date, human A(H5N1) infections following contact with an infected cat have not been documented. Avian Influenza A(H5N1) virus detections in humans remain unusual, and sustained human-to-human transmission has not been documented. To date, no symptomatic human contact of infected cats has been reported in Poland despite potentially close contact between cats and owners, &nbsp;and the capacity to detect a human case in contact with an infected cat is adequate in the country.&nbsp;  Therefore, based on current information, the risk of human infections following exposure to infected cats at the national level is assessed as low for the general population, and low to moderate for cat owners and those occupationally exposed to A(H5N1)-infected cats (such as veterinarians) without the use of appropriate personal protective equipment. Based on the current information, the risk for humans at the regional level is assessed as low, due to: i) avian influenza surveillance activities in animals in Europe being strengthened since September 2022, when the unprecedented geographical extent (37 European countries affected) resulted in 50 million poultry being culled in affected establishments; and (ii) Currently, there are no reported instances of human infection with the A(H5N1) virus acquired from cats, although A(H5N1) infection in domestic cats has been confirmed in Poland.  Due to the uncertainties related to this event, including the source of infection, the risk assessment may change. ",
2023-DON474,2023-DON474,2023-DON474,Assessment,"Between 2022 and June 2023, a few Member States in the European Region reported the detection of positive enterovirus, especially Echovirus 11 (E-11) cases. These include Croatia, France, Italy, Spain, Sweden and the UK. So far, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Norway have reported no increase of E-11 associated with cases of neonatal sepsis has been observed in 2022 and 2023.&nbsp; Based on the limited information available, WHO assesses the public health risk for the general population to be low. However, asymptomatic carriage and shedding of infectious viruses are a feature of enterovirus infection. Although some countries have enterovirus surveillance, there is no systematic European-wide enterovirus surveillance in place in the European Region. It is therefore difficult to estimate the extent of the current severe neonatal E-11 infections or background rates for circulation of E-11 viruses in the population. Without enterovirus surveillance, only the most severe cases will probably be detected through active efforts to test and type specimens from such cases. As non-polio enterovirus infection is often not a notifiable disease in Member States, additional cases of severe neonatal enterovirus infection may have gone undiagnosed and/or unreported.&nbsp; &nbsp;",

Undetected transmission of Marburg virus may exist in the country; not all chains of transmission were definitively linked, and one confirmed case was never identified. The initial source of the outbreak has not been identified, and a new emergence of disease is possible, including from interaction with animal reservoirs. The virus may also persist for an extended period in body fluids of survivors, including semen, underlying the importance of their participation in the survivors program, and the support the program provides.Based on the available information at the end of MVD outbreak in Equatorial Guinea, the risk of MVD remerging is considered as low&nbsp;at the national level, low at the subregional level, regional level and at the global level.",

MVD is caused by the same family (Filoviridae) as Ebola virus disease (EVD) and is clinically similar. In the early course of the disease, clinical diagnosis of MVD is difficult to distinguish from other tropical febrile illnesses because of the similarities in the clinical symptoms. Other viral hemorrhagic fevers need to be excluded, particularly Ebola diseases, as well as malaria, typhoid fever, and dengue. Epidemiologic features can help differentiate between diseases (i.e., exposure to bats, caves, or mining).Marburg virus has been isolated from fruit bats (Roussettus aegyptiacus) that are present in the United Republic of Tanzania and countries neighboring the affected Kagera region, therefore the same bat species may carry the virus in this region.Based on the available information at the end of MVD outbreak in the United Republic of Tanzania, the risk is considered as low&nbsp;at national level, low at the subregional level, regional level and at the global level.

2023-DON470,2023-DON470,2023-DON470,Assessment,"Fungal meningitis cases following a medical/surgical procedure are very infrequent and unusual. In 2012, the US CDC investigated a multistate outbreak of fungal meningitis and other infections among patients who received contaminated preservative-free methylprednisolone acetate&nbsp;( MPA) steroid injections; 753 cases were reported, including 64 deaths in 20 States in the USA. The source, vehicle, and the transmission route for the current outbreak remains unknown, although the investigations are ongoing. A fungal infection is suspected based on preliminary information provided by the health authorities from Mexico and the USA.Each year, more than a million people from the USA participate in medical tourism.

2023-DON469,2023-DON469,2023-DON469,Assessment,"A review of the epidemiological data collected from 2016 to 2022 in France through routine surveillance of enterovirus infections among hospitalized patients showed a significant increase in incidence and mortality for all severe neonatal infections associated with E-11, defined as infections with at least one organ failure and/or requiring admission to intensive care.A total of 443 enterovirus neonatal infections (severe and non-severe types) including seven deaths (case fatality rate, (CFR) 1.6%) were reported in France in 2022. Of these, 72% (n=317) had a known enterovirus type. &nbsp;E-11 was the predominant circulating enterovirus type (all ages included) and was identified in 30.3% (96 of 317) of neonatal infections (severe and non-severe) with known enterovirus type. It has been continuously detected since June 2022. Of the reported neonatal infections in 2022, 4.5% (22 of 443) were classified as severe. Of these 20 had known enterovirus types. E-11 represented 55% (11 of 20) of these cases as compared to 6.2% (3 of 48) of cases with known enterovirus type out of the total reported severe neonatal infections (n=62) between 2016 to 2021.&nbsp;In 2022, there were seven deaths (case fatality rate, (CFR) 1.6%) out of the cumulative 443 enterovirus neonatal infections recorded in 2022 (six associated with E-11), compared to seven deaths (CFR 0.4%), out of 1774 neonatal infections from 2016 to 2021(none associated with E-11). As mentioned above, there have also been seven deaths so far in 2023. Sequence analyses showed the circulation of at least two lineages of recombinant origin, of which the predominant one included all the sequences associated with the nine severe cases together with sequences associated with non-neonatal or non-severe neonatal infections. This new variant of E-11 had not been observed in France before July 2022, nor elsewhere based on available sequences on Genbank, as of 28 April 2023. As of 5 May 2023, E-11 sequences retrieved from samples collected in 2023 all belong to this predominant lineage. Although higher pathogenicity of this new lineage cannot be excluded, the severity of infections may also be explained by the young age, prematurity, and the absence of maternal immunity. Further analyses are warranted to delineate the characteristics of this recombinant virus.Based on the limited information available, WHO assesses the public health risk for the general population to be low. However, asymptomatic carriage and shedding of infectious viruses are a feature of enterovirus infection. Echovirus infection was confirmed in four out of five mothers by analyzing blood samples three days before or at delivery. There have been previous reports of severe E-11 infection in twin neonates, however, the observation of four sets of twins amongst nine cases is more than expected. As non-polio enterovirus infection is often not a notifiable disease in Member States, additional cases of severe neonatal enterovirus infection may have gone undiagnosed and/or unreported.",
2023-DON468,2023-DON468,2023-DON468,Assessment,"The two reported individuals with influenza A(H5N1) detection in their samples have remained asymptomatic and tested negative for influenza in their most recent samples to date. Their close contacts were asymptomatic and the follow-up period has been completed.Both cases were detected as part of an ongoing enhanced surveillance study of asymptomatic workers exposed to poultry infected with avian influenza. In these cases, detections may have resulted from either transient respiratory tract contamination (with no virus replication) or asymptomatic infection. Further testing (e.g., serology) is needed to confirm infection.Whenever avian influenza viruses are circulating in birds, humans who are exposed to these birds or their environments are at risk of infection.Sporadic human cases and transient contaminations of humans are rare, but not unexpected in such contexts. Thus far, there is no evidence of person-to-person transmission in this incident.&nbsp;Although both reported cases were asymptomatic in this instance, previous A(H5N1) infections have resulted in severe infections in humans.Based on the available information, WHO assesses that the risk for the general population posed by this virus is low, and for occupationally exposed persons it is low to moderate.",

2023-DON467,2023-DON467,2023-DON467,Assessment,"Both countries have reported MVD outbreaks for the first time.In Equatorial Guinea, while many cases are linked within a social network/gatherings or by geographic proximity, the earlier presence of cases and/or clusters across multiple districts without clear epidemiologic links may indicate undetected virus transmission. The last cases occurred in Bata, the most populated city and economic hub of Equatorial Guinea, with an airport and seaport, posing challenges for the response. The country surveillance system remains suboptimal, with few alerts reported. Additionally, there are population movements between the different districts of the mainland and island regions. Frequent population movements and porous land borders are also reported in the districts bordering Cameroon and Gabon, with suboptimal surveillance at land entry points and countless uncontrolled paths or trails along the border with Cameroon and Gabon.&nbsp;In the United Republic of Tanzania, the affected region, Kagera, borders three countries (Uganda to the north, and Rwanda and Burundi to the west) and Lake Victoria, and cross-border population movements may increase the risk of disease spread. Following the recent Ebola virus outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo from 23 April - 3 July 2022 and from 21 August - 27 September 2022, and Sudan ebolavirus outbreak in Uganda from 20 September 2022 to 11 January 2023, neighbouring countries in the subregion, including the United Republic of Tanzania, have been building preparedness capacities against filovirus diseases.&nbsp; However, an epidemiological investigation, which is still being carried out,&nbsp; has not revealed the source of the outbreak&nbsp; which may pose an additional risk to the population in the affected district.&nbsp;In March 2023, WHO assessed the public health risk posed by the MVD outbreaks in Equatorial Guinea and the United Republic of Tanzania as very high at the national level, high at the sub-regional level, moderate at the regional level, and low at the global level.&nbsp; WHO continues to monitor the situation in these two countries closely.",
2023-DON466,2023-DON466,2023-DON466,Assessment,"Cases of hepatitis E virus have been detected in South Sudan and the Bentiu IDP camp since 2018. If the WASH conditions are not improved, the potential risk to human health is high, especially for pregnant women and infants, as mother-to-infant transmission of HEV (during the third trimester of gestation) has been reported. &nbsp;The risk at the national level is assessed as high due to:Poor sanitation and hygiene practices, especially in the IDP camp;Limited availability of safe drinking water; Poor access to essential medical services; The presence of a large IDP population in South Sudan; Financial constraints impacting capacities to effectively contain the outbreak and limited local capacity to carry out response activities effectively; The limited availability of vaccine supply; Population movements; High risk of death in pregnant women in the absence of HEV vaccine introduction; &nbsp;The&nbsp;overall risk at the regional level is considered moderate due to the risk of disease spread between the mobile IDP populations and refugees who cross the borders between South Sudan, Sudan, and Ethiopia. In 2018, genomic sequencing of isolates from HEV cases reported in Bentiu IDP camp showed HEV genotype 1, closely related to strains isolated in the Chad basin and Northern Uganda. This highlights the risk of extensive regional spread in the current context that involves IDPs, refugees, and other populations of humanitarian concern. &nbsp;At the global level, the risk is low.&nbsp;",
2023-DON460,2023-DON460,2023-DON460,Assessment,"Measles is a highly contagious disease that occurs seasonally in endemic areas. Measles is still common in many developing countries, particularly in parts of Africa and Asia. Over 95% of measles deaths occur in countries with low per capita incomes and weak health infrastructures. Measles remains an important cause of death among young children globally, despite a safe and effective vaccine being available.There are several challenges that Ethiopia is facing in its efforts to increase national childhood vaccination coverage: conflict, population movement, and an insufficient stock of vaccines at the national level. These challenges are expected to fuel outbreaks and increase the number of cases. The overall risk at the national level is assessed as high due to the following factors:Active outbreaks as of 1 May 2023 in 44 woredas in 8 out of 13 regions:&nbsp; Afar, Amhara, Harari Oromia, SNNPR, SWEPR, Tigray, and Somali;Sub-optimal immunization coverage and low population immunity, Weak surveillance systems result in late detection of cases and inadequate outbreak investigations, especially at the community level. Furthermore, active surveillance is inconsistently implemented, likely resulting in under-reporting of cases and deaths;Poor health awareness in the affected community, resulting in inadequate health promotion and poor health-seeking behavior; Inadequate case management skills in handling complicated cases, further exacerbated by referral challenges associated with lack of transportation especially for patients from remote areas;Concurrent disease outbreaks (for example, cholera, pertussis, circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus) have limited the overall capacity and resources to respond to measles transmission;Concurrent complex humanitarian situations from widespread conflict, displacement, and severe and prolonged drought;Difficulty accessing and delivering supplies due to the poor road network and insecurity in western parts of Oromia, Benishangul Gumuz, Tigray, Afar, and Amhara;Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the health system.At the regional level, the overall risk is assessed as moderate due to the following factors:Ongoing severe drought in the Horn of Africa;Ongoing population movement;Conflict and insecurity in multiple countries in the region;Weak cross-border surveillance;Vulnerability of health systems within the region;Ongoing outbreaks within neighboring countries and suboptimal vaccination coverage.The risk has been assessed as low at global level.",

In some regions, Mastomys rodents are consumed as food. &nbsp;Although Nigeria is an endemic country for Lassa fever and has developed capacity to manage Lassa fever outbreaks, the current overall risk at the national level is considered high due to several factors: An increase in the number of confirmed cases compared with the same period in previous epidemic seasons; Reduced national capacity due to multiple ongoing health emergencies that have overwhelmed the country's health system and limited access to medical resources; Shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE), resulting in a high risk of healthcare-associated infections; Delays in sample transport for laboratory testing in several states, delaying confirmation of diagnosis and linkage to treatment and care; Inadequate health infrastructure, poor sanitation and the continued presence of disease-carrying rodents; and Lack of awareness and education about Lassa fever among the public and healthcare workers, likely leading to further delays in diagnosis and treatment, increasing the risk of transmission and potential deaths.&nbsp;The overall regional and global risks are considered low because the primary mode of transmission of Lassa fever is zoonotic and the rate of human-to-human transmission is low.&nbsp;",
2023-DON462,2023-DON462,2023-DON462,Assessment,"While measles is endemic in Indonesia and is reported yearly, the magnitude and extent of this outbreak is high compared to previous years. Based on the current data and available information, the overall risk of measles at the national level is assessed as high for the following reasons:Likely under-detection and under-reporting of measles cases due to non-availability of laboratory reagents for confirmation of cases. The number of suspect measles cases reported in the Early Warning Alert and Response System (EWARS) has continued to increase since week 1 in 2023. An increase in hospitalization of suspect measles cases is observed in some provinces, including Papua province.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Low MCV1 and MCV2 coverage in most provinces, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic (2020-2021); 28% of the birth cohort in 2021 have not received any measles vaccination and are thus at high risk for measles infection. Also, 22% of the children have been only partially vaccinated. Low measles-containing vaccine supplemental immunization activities (MCV-SIA) coverage in 2022, especially in high-risk provinces. There is vaccine hesitancy in the high-risk provinces, and limited capacity for outbreak response immunization (ORI), which is also impacted due to vaccine hesitancy.&nbsp; Low surveillance sensitivity in 2020-2021. As surveillance improved in 2022, more cases were reported from the subnational level. The overall surveillance sensitivity of measles and rubella i.e., the non-measles  non rubella (NMNR) discard rate, was 3.33 per 100,000 population compared to the global standard of &ge;2.0 per 100000 population. However, only 33% (170) districts achieved at least 2 NMNR discarded rate. In 2023, NMNR discard rate to date is at 0.46.The B3 genotype detected in West Kalimantan and East Java is not originally endemic to Indonesia.",
2023-DON454,2023-DON454,2023-DON454,Assessment,"Nigeria has implemented interventions to combat meningitis, including introducing the meningococcal A (MenA) conjugate vaccine against NmA from 2011-2022. Through preventive campaigns, Nigeria has &nbsp;vaccinated over 100 million people aged 1 to 29 years, and the vaccine has been included in the country&rsquo;s routine immunization schedule since 2019. Among MenA vaccinated populations in countries of the meningitis belt, the incidence of serogroup A meningitis has declined by more than 99%, and no serogroup A case has been confirmed since 2017. However, there are still annual reports of meningitis cases in the country that are associated mostly with meningococcus serogroup C (NmC).Insecurity, particularly in Northeast Nigeria, affects vaccination coverage, especially in areas controlled by non-state armed groups. At the national level, immunization coverage remains suboptimal at 50% as of 2021. Licensed vaccines against meningococcal, pneumococcal and Haemophilus influenzae diseases have been available for many years. These bacteria have several different strains (known as serotypes or serogroups), and vaccines are designed to protect against the most harmful strains. Over time, there have been major improvements in strain coverage and vaccine availability, but no universal vaccine against these infections exists.Additionally, in November 2022, an outbreak of meningitis was confirmed in the Zinder region of Niger. This region borders Jigawa, which is the worst-affected state in Nigeria. The risk of cross-border transmission is high due to the population movement across the border.Based on the above information, the overall risk of meningitis in Nigeria is assessed as high at the national level, moderate at the regional level, and low at the global level.",
2023-DON452,2023-DON452,2023-DON452,Assessment,"Diphtheria cases are under-reported in Nigeria, with few reports of outbreaks in the past. The last outbreak was reported between February and November 2011 in the village of Kimba and its surrounding settlements in Borno State, north-eastern Nigeria, where 98 cases were reported. The diphtheria toxoid-containing vaccine third dose coverage in Nigeria is suboptimal. According to the 2021 Nigeria Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) and National Immunization Coverage Survey (NICS), the third dose of pentavalent vaccine coverage was 57% in 2021.The country is currently faced with several public health emergencies such as Lassa fever, cholera, mpox, meningitis and a humanitarian emergency in the northeast of the country. Due to insecurity, especially in north-eastern Nigeria, vaccination coverage remains suboptimal, especially in the areas controlled by non-state armed groups. Therefore, the outbreak of diphtheria further complicates and strains the already overstretched resources. The global supply of diphtheria antitoxin (DAT) is limited, and this may affect the availability of the required doses in a timely manner.The overall risk of diphtheria in Nigeria was assessed as high at the national level, low at the regional level, and low at the global level.",
2023-DON461,2023-DON461,2023-DON461,Assessment,"WHO&rsquo;s risk assessment remains unchanged since the last update.  According to the preliminary findings of the local epidemiological investigation, the most plausible hypothesis about transmission is that it occurred through environmental exposure to areas where either sick or dead birds or sea mammals were found close to the residence of the case. According to the information received thus far, the virus has not been detected in other individuals. Whenever avian influenza viruses are circulating in poultry, wild birds or mammals, there is a risk for sporadic infection and small clusters of human cases due to exposure to infected animals or contaminated environments. Public health measures have been implemented by both the human and animal health agencies, including monitoring healthcare workers and other contacts of the laboratory-confirmed case. Currently available epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that A(H5) viruses, including H5N1, have not acquired the capacity for sustained transmission among humans, thus the likelihood of human-to-human spread is low. Based on available information, WHO assesses the risk to the general population posed by this virus to be low. Should infected individuals from affected areas travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during travel or after arrival. If this were to occur, further community-level spread is considered unlikely as this virus has not acquired the ability to transmit easily among humans. The preliminary risk assessment will be reviewed as needed should further epidemiological or virological information become available.",
2023-DON457,2023-DON457,2023-DON457,Assessment,"The primary risk associated with any new cVDPV2 is gaps in routine immunization. The risk of further spread of such strains, or the emergence of new strains, is magnified by decreased immunization rates related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

There is no evidence that this virus poses a greater risk of spread, including international spread, than other VDPV2s that are derived from Sabin vaccines.&nbsp;",
2023-DON458,2023-DON458,2023-DON458,Assessment,"WHO assesses the risk to be high at the national level. Despite Indonesia having a strong capacity to respond to poliovirus outbreaks and West Java having a moderate to strong outbreak response capacity to interrupt transmission, there is a high susceptibility of the population to poliovirus type 2 after switching from trivalent to bivalent OPV; sub-optimal IPV coverage in Aceh, West Java and several other provinces in Indonesia; high population mobility between West Java and other provinces within Indonesia; and reluctance to vaccinate among at-risk populations. The outbreak in Indonesia poses a moderate regional risk and a low risk globally. The detection of cVDPVs highlights the importance of maintaining high levels of routine vaccination coverage everywhere to minimize the risk and consequences of the circulation of any poliovirus, as well as the need to ensure quality surveillance for early detection of any poliovirus.",

In addition to the nine confirmed cases reported in the Disease Outbreak News of 22 March, six more individuals have tested positive for MVD, with an additional affected province. While many cases are linked within a social network or by geographic proximity, the presence of cases and/or clusters across multiple districts without clear epidemiologic links may indicate undetected transmission of the virus. The presence of confirmed cases in Bata increases the risk of disease spread, as it is the most populated city and economic hub of Equatorial Guinea, with an international airport and port. Bata has also reported the highest number of confirmed cases and confirmed deaths. The last case was also reported from Bata and investigation is ongoing to establish transmission chains. The country surveillance system remains suboptimal with few alerts reported and investigated. Several epidemiological links and transmission chains have not been detected, thus there might be contacts not identified. Implemented infection prevention and control measures are insufficient as demonstrated by MVD cases reported among healthcare workers. The diagnostic capacity for Marburg virus in the country is limited in terms of the number of samples that can be analyzed per day (a maximum of around 50 a day).&nbsp;The community's perception of risk is estimated to be very low.&nbsp;There are frequent population movements between the different districts of the mainland region, as well as with the island region, despite the quarantine measures implemented in several of the affected areas.

This is the third reported human infection with A(H3N8) from China. Two previous cases were reported in April and May 2022. One of the previous cases developed a critical illness, while the other had a mild illness. Both cases likely acquired infection from direct or indirect exposure to infected poultry. So far, no additional cases linked with this case, nor the previous cases, have been reported. According to reports from health officials, the preliminary epidemiological investigation into this event suggests that exposure to a live poultry market may have been the cause of infection.

2023-DON455,2023-DON455,2023-DON455,Assessment,"Togo is part of the African meningitis belt and annually records meningitis cases and deaths. Although the country has experience in the management of meningococcal meningitis outbreaks over the past years, the current Streptococcus pneumoniae outbreak is unusual as the country has never managed a pneumococcal meningitis outbreak in the past, and national capacity is limited.&nbsp; To date, no imported cases have been reported in neighbouring countries. However, several factors are likely to increase the risk of spread, including the country's location in the African meningitis belt; the epidemic season, which typically runs from January to June; constraints in the provision of vaccination services, which do not allow for optimal vaccination coverage to protect the population; the fact that the main age groups affected by the outbreak are not protected by the routine vaccination against Streptococcus pneumoniae introduced in Togo in 2014; the security crisis in the Sahel, affecting the Savanes region, hampering public health interventions and causing population movements; the precarious economic conditions in the country, particularly in the Savanes region; and the suboptimal surveillance capacity for early case detection, diagnosis and treatment in the Oti Sud district.&nbsp;Neighbouring countries are also in the African meningitis belt, and the Oti Sud district borders Ghana and Benin, making it possible for the disease to spread to other countries in the region.Considering the above-described situation, WHO assesses the overall risk posed by this outbreak as high at the national level, moderate at the regional level, and low at the global level.",

2023-DON451,2023-DON451,2023-DON451,Assessment,"The United Republic of Tanzania has reported its first outbreak of MVD, which is a highly virulent disease, with a fatality ratio of up to 90%. The affected region, Kagera, borders three countries (Uganda to the north, and Rwanda and Burundi to the west) and Lake Victoria, and cross-border population movements may increase the risk of disease spread. In addition, Marburg virus has been isolated from fruit bats (Roussettus aegyptiacus) in Tanzania and countries neighboring the affected Kagera region, therefore, the same bat species may carry the virus in this region. Due to the high CFR and existing risk of spread of the outbreak to other areas of the country, inadequate human, financial and material resources to implement response interventions, and the likelihood of existing capacities being overwhelmed if the cases increase, the risk at the national level is assessed as very high.  Following the recent Ebola virus outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo from 23 April - 3 July 2022 and from 21 August - 27 September 2022, and Sudan ebolavirus outbreak in Uganda from 20 September 2022 to 11 January 2023, neighbouring countries in the subregion, including the United Republic of Tanzania, have been building preparedness capacities against filovirus diseases.

2023-DON450,2023-DON450,2023-DON450,Assessment,"Botulinum neurotoxins are dangerous toxins produced by several species of the genus Clostridium (e.g.,&nbsp;C. botulinum,&nbsp;C. baratii,&nbsp;C. butyricum, and&nbsp;C. sporogenes) under anaerobic conditions. Botulinum neurotoxins are one of the most lethal substances known and occur in eight serotypes (A to H). Botulinum neurotoxins block nerve functions and can lead to muscular, including respiratory, paralysis. Human botulism is a naturally occurring rare disease and may refer to foodborne botulism, infant botulism, wound botulism, and inhalation botulism. Clostridium botulinum culture is used to produce pharmaceutical botulinum toxin-containing products. These pharmaceutical products employ the purified and heavily diluted botulinum neurotoxin (type A or type B, depending on the indication) injected for clinical use for the treatment of more than 20 neurological and non-neurological disorders, as well as for cosmetic use. Treatment is administered in the medical setting, tailored according to the needs of the patient and desired treatment effect. The symptoms of botulism can be very severe, requiring intensive-care treatment as well as the administration of specific anti-toxins. Even when such treatments are available, severe botulism cases require supportive treatment, including mechanical ventilation. Complete recovery usually takes weeks to months.This current event is possibly linked to a specific procedure and/or a medical product in at least two healthcare settings. Further investigations are ongoing regarding case ascertainment and notification. The investigation remains open for other possible hypotheses of intoxication. The respective departments in the two clinics where the procedures were undertaken have been closed since 1 March, with no further cases reported.There are several clinical indications for the use of botulinum neurotoxin; however, its off-label use in bariatric cases has increased in many countries.

2023-DON448,2023-DON448,2023-DON448,Assessment,"Dengue and chikungunya can have serious public health impacts. The viruses that cause these infections have been circulating in the Region of the Americas for decades due to the widespread spread of the Aedes spp. mosquitoes (mainly, Aedes aegypti). These arboviruses can be carried by infected travelers (imported cases) and may establish new areas of local transmission in the presence of vectors and a susceptible population. As they are arboviruses, all populations in areas where the mosquito vectors are present are at risk, however, the impact is greatest among the most vulnerable people, for which the arboviral disease programs do not have enough resources to respond to outbreaks.Although dengue and chikungunya are endemic in most tropical and subtropical countries of the Americas and the Caribbean, increased transmission and expansion of chikungunya cases has been observed beyond historical areas of transmission. Furthermore, 2023 is showing intense dengue transmission.The impact of the increased transmission in the Region will depend on several factors, including country capacities for a coordinated public health response and for clinical management; the early start of the arbovirus season in the southern cone; high mosquito densities due to interrupted vector control activities during the COVID-19 pandemic; and the large population susceptible to arbovirus infections, particularly in areas where these viruses are newly circulating. Competing disease priorities and risks may adversely affect disease control and proper clinical management, because of (i) misdiagnosis, given that chikungunya and dengue symptoms may be non-specific and resemble other infections, including Zika and measles, potentially leading to inadequate case management; (ii) overwhelmed healthcare facilities in some areas dealing with a high caseload and other concurrent outbreaks; and (iii) the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the decrease of resources available to arboviral disease programs and the need for capacity building and training of vector-control and healthcare workers, as well as maintenance and procurement of equipment and insecticides to perform vector control activities.The apparent higher proportion of acute meningoencephalitis attributed to chikungunya in Paraguay is of concern. It is not yet known what is causing a higher rate of neurologic disease, which is considered an atypical clinical presentation. Sequencing has identified the East-Central-South-African (ECSA) lineage, which is expanding in geographic range within the region, having first been identified in Brazil in 2014. Introduction of chikungunya virus into new areas with immunologically na&iuml;ve populations would promote further spread. Aedes spp. mosquitoes are widely distributed in the Region of the Americas, therefore cross-border transmission of dengue and chikungunya is likely. Countries bordering areas with very high transmission of these diseases may be at higher risk, &nbsp;e.g., those adjacent to Bolivia (dengue) and Paraguay (chikungunya). Additionally, the Southern Hemisphere summer, with high temperatures and high levels of humidity, affects vector dynamics and may increase the likelihood of arboviruses transmission. Thus, the risk at the regional level is assessed as high, due to the widespread presence of the mosquito vector species (especially Aedes aegypti), the continued risk of severe disease and even death, and the expansion outside of historical areas of transmission, where all the population, including risk groups and healthcare workers, may not be aware of warning signs and may be immunologically na&iuml;ve. Moreover, one country in the Region (Paraguay) is experiencing an unprecedented increase of chikungunya cases, and another country in the Region (Bolivia) is experiencing high incidence of dengue cases.Other challenges reported by Member States in the Region include stockouts of several essential supplies for prevention and control, lack of reagents and consumables for laboratory diagnosis, and the need for re-training of field teams and health workers. In addition, higher transmission rates are expected in the coming months, due to weather conditions favourable for vector breeding in the first semester of the year in the southern hemisphere.",

Factors including the spread of the outbreak to neighboring districts and provinces, the detection of measles cases in a highly mobile population and minority communities, the low population immunity in affected districts, and cross-border movement, indicates the risk of intra- and inter-provincial as well as international spread of measles. The risk at regional level is assessed to be moderate (persistent endemic transmission on both sides of a porous international border), and low at the global level.&nbsp;&nbsp;",
2023-DON446,2023-DON446,2023-DON446,Assessment,"While measles is endemic in Nepal and is reported every year, the magnitude and extent of the current outbreak are unusually high compared to the previous years. Only sporadic isolated measles cases have occurred since 2004, when a substantial outbreak of 12 074 cases was reported. Based on the current data and available information, the overall risk of measles at the national level is assessed as high due to the following reasons: The outbreak initially reported in Nepalgunj SMC in Lumbini province has expanded, and cases are being reported in adjoining municipalities and provinces in western Nepal, and also eastern Nepal.The number of cases might be higher than reported, as cases in communities are not always counted due to suboptimal surveillance activities and underreporting of identified cases.

2023-DON445,2023-DON445,2023-DON445,Assessment,"These are the first human infections reported in Cambodia since 2014. Human infection can cause severe disease and has a high mortality rate. Almost all Influenza A (H5N1) infection cases in people have been associated with close contact with infected live or dead birds, or Influenza A (H5N1)-contaminated environments. Based on evidence so far, the virus does not infect humans easily and spreads from person-to-person appears to be unusual. An outbreak investigation is ongoing including identifying the source of exposure of the two reported cases to the virus. Since the virus continues to be detected in poultry populations, further human cases can be expected.Whenever avian influenza viruses are circulating in poultry, there is a risk for sporadic infection or small clusters of human cases due to exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments. From 2003 to 25 February 2023, a total of 873 human cases of infection with influenza A (H5N1) and 458 deaths have been reported globally from 21 countries. Public health measures from both the human and animal health agencies have been implemented including monitoring of contacts of the laboratory-confirmed cases. While further characterization of the virus from these human cases is pending, available epidemiological and virological evidence suggest that current A(H5) viruses have not acquired the ability of sustained transmission among humans, thus the likelihood of sustained human-to-human spread is low. Based on available information so far, WHO assesses the risk to the general population posed by this virus to be low.The risk assessment will be reviewed as needed as further epidemiological or virological information becomes available. Vaccines against avian influenza A (H5N1) for human use have been developed for pandemic use but are not widely available. WHO, through its Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) monitors the evolution of the virus, conducts risk assessment, and recommends the development of additional new candidate vaccine viruses for pandemic preparedness purposes. Close analysis of the epidemiological situation, further characterization of the most recent viruses (human and poultry) and serological investigations are critical to assess associated risk and to adjust risk management measures promptly.",
2023-DON444,2023-DON444,2023-DON444,Assessment,"Equatorial Guinea is facing an outbreak of MVD for the first time and the country's capacity to manage the outbreak is insufficient.Based on available information, all nine deceased cases were in contact with a relative with the same symptoms or participated in a burial of a person with symptoms compatible with MVD. At this stage it cannot be ruled out that all MVD cases have been identified, therefore there could be transmission chains that have not been tracked. To date, most of the contacts of the nine deceased cases have not been identified. It should also be noted that with the exception of one case who died in a health facility, the other eight died in the community and their burial conditions are unknown.Cross-border population movements are frequent, and the borders are very porous, between Ebebiyin and Nsock Nsomo districts (Equatorial Guinea), Cameroon and Gabon. This constitutes a risk of cross-border spread.Considering the above described scenario, the risk is considered high at the national level, moderate at the regional level and low at the global level.",
2023-DON443,2023-DON443,2023-DON443,Assessment,"Cholera is endemic in Mozambique and cholera outbreaks have been reported in the country every year during the hot and rainy season (October to April), mainly from Nampula, Cabo Delgado, Sofala and Tete provinces. However, the current outbreak has greater geographical extent than outbreaks reported in 2019-2022, when no more than three provinces were affected during the year.&nbsp;&nbsp;The first cholera case of the current outbreak was reported from Lago district on 14 September 2022, Niassa province, located in the northern region of the country, which shares a border with Malawi and Tanzania. All six provinces currently affected by cholera are located in the Zambezia Valley, which is a flood-prone area. As the rainy season continues, it is anticipated that more districts will be affected. The rainy season lasts until March-April, usually with a peak of rainfall recorded in January and early February. Heavy rainfall has already been reported in seven out of eleven provinces in the first weeks of February (31 January to 9 February), with flooding in Maputo province leading to displacement and disruption of the water supply system. There is inadequate access to safe drinking water sources for the population that is already challenged with poor hygiene and sanitation and the current rainy season could contribute to sustained disease transmission.&nbsp; Several affected provinces, such as Niassa, Tete and Zambezia, are bordering Malawi, which is currently facing its deadliest cholera outbreak in history. The borders with Malawi are porous with frequent movement across the border between the two countries. On 26 January 2023, Zambia notified WHO of a cholera outbreak in its Eastern Province bordering Malawi and Mozambique, where one of the two index cases had just returned from Mozambique. There remains a high risk of spread to other countries in the region, including Tanzania and Zimbabwe and further to South Africa. Considering the history of cross-border spread of cholera during this outbreak, the risk of further disease spread is therefore considered very high at the national and regional levels.&nbsp;",
2023-DON442,2023-DON442,2023-DON442,Assessment,"The overall risk is assessed by WHO as high at the national level due to the following reasons:Although Nipah virus cases are reported in Bangladesh almost every year, 11 cases and eight deaths, have already been reported in 2023, which is unusual compared to the past seven years.The case fatality rate from Nipah virus infection is high (73%). Initial signs and symptoms of Nipah virus infection are non-specific, and the diagnosis is often not suspected at the time of presentation.&nbsp;This can hinder accurate diagnosis and creates challenges in outbreak detection, effective and timely infection control measures, and outbreak response activities.There are currently no specific drugs or vaccines available for Nipah virus infection although WHO has identified Nipah as a priority disease for the WHO Research and Development Blueprint.&nbsp; Intensive supportive care is recommended to treat severe respiratory and neurologic complications.Currently, the level of awareness among the general population is still low, despite ongoing efforts for risk communication and community engagement.There has already been one case of suspected human-to-human transmission during the current outbreak and secondary cases have previously been reported in Bangladesh.Fruit bats or flying foxes (Pteropus species.), the natural reservoir of Nipah virus, is present in Bangladesh and the genetic diversity of Nipah virus isolated from affected persons in Bangladesh suggest substantial diversity of the virus in the wildlife reservoir and repeated spill over of the virus from its reservoir to the human population.The risk at the regional level is moderate as Rajshahi district borders India. Although there have not been any instances of cross-border transmission by humans previously, this risk remains given the shared ecological corridor for the virus&rsquo;s natural host (fruit bats or flying foxes) and occurrence among domestic animals and humans previously in both countries. India also has experienced previous outbreaks of Nipah virus infection.The risk assessed at the global level is low considering the absence of natural hosts in many countries and the fact that there have been no previous cases outside Bangladesh, India, Malaysia, and Singapore.",
2023-DON437,2023-DON437,2023-DON437,Assessment,"The risk of cholera is not equally distributed between regions, countries or within countries. The risk of cholera increases with decreasing access to clean water and sanitation.However, there are a number of outbreaks occurring simultaneously across all six WHO regions (the African Region, the Region of the Americas, the Eastern Mediterranean Region, the European Region,iii the South-East Asia Region,iv the Western Pacific Region), which are straining the overall epidemic response capacity. Protracted cholera outbreaks are exhausting public health response personnel and depleting global and local resources.  Several countries including Cameroon, Ethiopia, Haiti, Lebanon, Nigeria (north-east of the country), Pakistan, Somalia, Syria and the Democratic Republic of Congo (eastern part of the country) are in the midst of complex humanitarian crises with fragile health systems, inadequate access to clean water and sanitation and have insufficient capacity to respond to the outbreaks. Climate change and a lack of development are also contributing to outbreaks. In addition, many affected countries have highly mobile populations that may spread cholera to neighbouring countries (e.g. high risk of spread between Malawi and Mozambique, and to Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe; the surge in cases in DRC&rsquo;s North and South Kivu provinces increases the risk for spread to Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda; in Somalia, the uncontrolled cross-border movement of people, including refugees/asylum seekers with neighbouring countries especially Ethiopia, Kenya, Djibouti and Yemen; heavy population movement between Pakistan-Afghanistan, Iraq-Iran; the outbreak from Syria has spread to Lebanon with a continued risk of spread into Jordan). There is also a risk of spreading to currently unaffected areas by international travel to countries such as Sierra Leone and Liberia, which are at high risk for cholera outbreaks. After at least 10 reported imported cases from Haiti between October 2022 and January 2023, the neighbouring Dominican Republic continues to report cases linked to local transmission in 2023. There is the risk of further spread in the Americas. Cross-border population movements and increased global travel following the lefting of COVID-19-related restrictions, increase the risk of further international spread.  In October 2022, the ICG made the unprecedented decision to temporarily suspend the second dose of OCV for outbreak response, due to the global shortage of OCV, which continues in 2023. Although effective, the single-dose strategy will result in a shortened duration of vaccine-induced immunity, particularly in children under five years of age, leaving the populations vulnerable to cholera the following year. Based on the current situation, in particular: 1) the increasing number of outbreaks and geographical expansion; 2) the complex humanitarian context of many crises; 3) continuous risk of spread; 4) lack of vaccines and limited response capacity (supplies, human resources), the risk at the global level is assessed as very high and cholera remains a global threat to public health and an indicator of inequity and lack of social development.",
2023-DON441,2023-DON441,2023-DON441,Assessment,"Cholera is endemic in parts of DRC. In 2022, according to data from the National Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response System, a total of 18 403 suspected cases of cholera, including 302 deaths (CFR 1.6%), were notified in the DRC, in 104 HZs of 19 of the 26 provinces of the country. However, the current epidemic is showing a rapid upsurge in a fragile context such as IDPs camps.For years, DRC has been experiencing several armed and community conflicts, particularly in the east, putting the country in a state of unprecedented humanitarian and health crisis.Due to internal armed clashes, which intensified in 2022, nearly 450 857 new IDPs arrived in North Kivu (which already hosts 1.9 million of IDPs). Of them, 53.4% (240 579) are hosted in the territory of Nyiragongo and particularly 97.7% (235 111) in IDPs sites, which are characterized by overcrowding, poor hygiene and sanitation conditions, very limited access to drinking water, latrines and basic health services.&nbsp;In addition, population movements are regularly observed between the affected HZs and the other HZs in the province of North Kivu as well as the rest of the country, where the populations also have limited access to drinking water, good hygiene and sanitation conditions, as well as to health care facilities.Moreover, the current rainy season may favor the spread of the epidemic in other HZs.With the ongoing armed conflicts, displacements are likely to continue, leading to a worsening of the humanitarian context and the vulnerabilities of the populations, including the need for basic social services. All this is evolving in a context of a fragile health system; recurrent attacks on hospital infrastructures and reduced availability of services. Other outbreaks are also ongoing (COVID-19, yellow fever, poliomyelitis, measles, mpox (monkeypox), meningitis, etc.) and there are extremely limited human, material and financial resources.The risk of cholera spreading to neighboring countries cannot be ruled out. Indeed, there are population movements between the affected health zones and neighboring countries, including Rwanda and Uganda.The affected HZs border the city of Goma, which has an international airport. Countries in the Great Lakes sub-region (Rwanda, Uganda, Burundi), which are most at risk of cholera importation from the current epidemic hotspots in North Kivu, have inadequate levels of access to health care, poor drinking water, hygienic and sanitary conditions. A cholera epidemic is also ongoing in Burundi with 120 suspected cases and 1 death reported as of 7 February 2023. This epidemic affects the city of Bujumbura, which is located on the shores of Lake Tanganyika on the border with South Kivu, with population movements across the border.The outbreak is occurring against a backdrop of a surge in cholera outbreaks globally, which has constrained the availability of vaccines, tests, and treatments.Considering the above-described scenario, WHO assesses the risk posed by this outbreak as high at the national and regional level, and low at the global level.",
2023-DON440,2023-DON440,2023-DON440,Assessment,"In South Sudan, outbreaks of measles remain a concern due to insufficient vaccination coverage, the non-introduction of the second dose of MCV (MCV2) and the absence of supplementary vaccination activities against measles in some areas over the past three years. South Sudan is one of the African countries with the lowest measles immunization coverage, resulting in suboptimal population immunity. The 2020 WHO-UNICEF estimates of National Immunization Coverage (WUENIC) for the first dose of measles containing vaccine (MCV1) were estimated to be 49%.&nbsp; Based on the measles risk analysis conducted in March 2022, 49 counties out of 80 (69%) in 10 states and three administrative areas are classified as &ldquo;very high risk&rdquo; for measles transmission. All states and three administrative areas, except for the Western Equatoria, are classified as &ldquo;very high risk&rdquo;. The assessment found that out of 80 counties, eight (10%) have a low risk of measles and 12(15%) are classified as &lsquo;medium&rsquo; risk when assessing population immunity. The remaining 60 counties (75%) are classified as either &ldquo;high risk&rdquo; or &ldquo;very high risk&rdquo; for measles. This risk analysis looked at several factors including population immunity, surveillance quality, immunization programme, and threat assessment (factors that might influence the risk for measles virus exposure and transmission in the population). Although most counties recorded very high administrative coverage for immunization for measles during reactive campaigns conducted between March and November 2022, vaccination quality was not determined by a post-campaign evaluation (PCE).Low routine immunization coverage (69%), far below the WHO recommended sustained homogeneous coverage of at least 95%, is the main underlying cause of the multiple outbreaks in South Sudan. The low routine immunization is attributed to several factors including low access to basic healthcare estimated at 44%; insecurity that affects the functioning of health facilities; and inconsistent implementation of the basic package for nutrition and health services by public and partner-supported health facilities. South Sudan is also experiencing severe food insecurity with 57% of the population (6.54 million people) being affected. This has increased the risk of malnutrition in children, thereby increasing the risk of severe measles and adverse outcomes, especially those with vitamin A deficiency or whose immune systems have been weakened by HIV or other chronic diseases.Due to these multiple factors outlined above, the risk of spread of measles at the national level is assessed as high. At regional level, the risk is assessed to be moderate due to the cross-border movement of populations fleeing armed conflicts and insecurity in neighboring countries (Ethiopia, Sudan, Uganda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Kenya) with suboptimal coverage of routine vaccination.The risk at the global level is considered as low given the existing response capacity in place.",
2022-DON435,2022-DON435,2022-DON435,Assessment,"Cholera is endemic in Malawi with seasonal outbreaks occurring during the wet season. The first major outbreak occurred in 1998 and was widespread in the Southern Region, with 25 000 cases reported. Prior to the current outbreak, the largest outbreak in Malawi occured from October 2001 to April 2002, and affected 26 of the 29 districts, with 33 546 cases and 968 deaths (CFR 3%).&nbsp; Following floods in the southern region in January 2022, the Ministry of Health confirmed a cholera outbreak on 3 March 2022. This outbreak, which was initially limited to the Southern Region and the flood-affected areas, has now spread to all the regions and districts in the country. Transmission has continued during the dry season (June to October), which is traditionally a low transmission period for Malawi. With the onset of the rainy season from November through May, the number and spread of cholera cases is expected to increase further. Therefore, the risk is considered to be very high at the national level. The poor WASH capacities in the affected districts, especially in the fishing communities along Lake Malawi, pose risk for the continuous propagation of the cholera outbreak nationally, to neighbouring countries and in the region.Two reactive single-dose OCV campaigns have been carried out in parts of 21 affected districts, however unvaccinated sub-districts and districts still remain at risk. Other identified challenges from the most at-risk districts include inadequate capacity for case management and diagnosis in the affected areas resulting in delayed case detection and poor outcomes. This is further exacerbated due to delayed care-seeking behaviour of the community.There is a continued risk for further increase in the number of cases and international spread. Confirmed cases have been reported across the border in Mozambique and the risk for cross-border transmission between Malawi and Mozambique remains high during the current outbreak.The country has experience in controlling cholera outbreaks. However, due to concurrent outbreaks (polio, COVID-19), the large geographic spread of the outbreak (with cases reported in all districts) and the high case numbers, the current burden is overstraining existing national response capacity and resources as well as the capacity of partners&rsquo; support. In addition, there are multiple ongoing large cholera outbreaks worldwide. This is stretching limited global stocks of cholera supplies and OCV, which limits available resources for Malawi and the region. WHO assesses the risk of this outbreak to be very high at national and regional level. On 21 January 2023, WHO assessed the risk of the global cholera outbreak as very high due to ongoing multiple cholera outbreaks in many WHO regions.&nbsp;",
2023-DON436,2023-DON436,2023-DON436,Assessment,"Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a viral respiratory infection of humans and dromedary camels which is caused by a coronavirus called Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Infection with MERS-CoV can cause severe disease resulting in high mortality. Since 2012, globally the case fatality rate (CFR) for MERS-CoV cases is approximately 36%, but this may be an overestimate of the true mortality rate, as mild cases of MERS may be missed by existing surveillance systems and until more is known about the disease, the case fatality rates are counted only amongst the laboratory-confirmed cases reported to WHO. Humans are infected with MERS-CoV from direct or indirect contact with dromedaries who are a host and zoonotic source of MERS-CoV infection. MERS-CoV has demonstrated the ability to be transmitted between humans. So far, the observed non-sustained human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts and in healthcare settings. Outside of the healthcare setting there has been limited human-to human transmission.Cases of MERS-CoV infection are rare in Oman.&nbsp; Since June 2013, a total of 26 MERS-CoV cases and seven deaths, including this current case, have been reported to WHO from Oman. The total number of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection cases reported globally to WHO is 2603 including 935 associated deaths (CFR 36%) as of December 2022. The majority of the reported cases have occurred in countries in the Arabian Peninsula. Outside of this region, there has been one large outbreak in the Republic of Korea, in May 2015, during which 186 laboratory-confirmed cases (185 in Republic of Korea and one in China) and 38 deaths (CFR 21%) were reported. The global number reflects the total number of laboratory-confirmed cases and deaths reported to WHO under IHR (2005) to date. The notification of this case does not change the overall risk assessment. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East and/or other countries where MERS-CoV is circulating in dromedaries, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who were exposed to the virus through contact with dromedaries or their products (for example, consumption of raw camel milk), or in a healthcare setting. WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessments based on the latest available information.",
2023-DON439,2023-DON439,2023-DON439,Assessment,"The ongoing outbreak shows both an increased number of cases and an increased growth rate compared to the previous seasons.Moreover, the meningitis epidemic season (usually from January to June, marked by high temperatures and dry winds combined with heavy dust, a period known as the harmattan), the mixing of populations, the simultaneous occurrence of other epidemics in the same region (measles, diphtheria and COVID-19), insecurity and population displacement, all in the context of a protracted humanitarian crisis, are likely to contribute to the spread of the outbreak.The Zinder region borders Jigawa State in Nigeria, where a NmC outbreak is also ongoing, confirming the risk of international spread to other countries of the West African subregion.WHO assesses the risk posed by the current meningitis outbreak in Niger as high at the national level, moderate at the regional level, and low at the global level.",
2023-DON438,2023-DON438,2023-DON438,Assessment,"In 2016, the WHO Region of the Americas was the first Region of the World Health Organization (WHO) to be declared free of the endemic transmission of measles virus by the International Expert Committee (IEC) for documenting and verifying measles, rubella and the congenital rubella syndrome in the Americas. However, keeping the Region free of measles is an ongoing challenge due to the permanent risk of importation and reintroduction of the virus. In 2021, five countries and territories (countries hereafter) have achieved &ge;95% coverage for the first dose of MMR (MMR1) in the Region of the Americas, while 13 countries had MMR1 coverage of less than 80%. For MMR2, only two countries had &ge;95% coverage and 36 countries had less than 80% coverage.Several factors have contributed to the outbreaks of measles in the Region of the Americas occurring between 2017 and 2022, including lack of compliance with 2-dose measles vaccination coverage, influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic. During the same period, there are gaps in the performance of international indicators for integrated measles/rubella surveillance. In Paraguay, risk of disruption to routine immunization activities remains due to both the COVID-19 related burden on the health system and decreased demand for measles vaccination because of physical distancing requirements or community reluctance. Disruption of immunization services, even for brief periods, can result in an increased number of susceptible individuals and raise the likelihood of outbreak-prone vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs) such as measles.",
2022-DON352,2022-DON352,2022-DON352,Assessment,"Suspected HEV cases have been detected in Chad after nearly four years without any reported cases. Heavy rains causing flooding have created favourable conditions for HEV transmission, including a large amount of displaced people living in precarious situations where clean drinking water, sanitation, hygiene, and health services are limited. The main risks of spread at the national level are 1) poor sanitation and hygiene practices especially in areas affected by floods; 2) high rates of open defecation; 3) lack of access to safe drinking water; and 4) presence of large internally displaced population. At a regional level the risk of HEV transmission is currently low. However, the risk may be affected by the increased number of displaced persons in Tandjile region and from other southern regions of the country, some of which share a border with Cameroon and the Central African Republic. HEV outbreaks are currently occurring in South Sudan and Sudan, however no epidemiological links have been established with the outbreak in Chad. During the last documented outbreak in Chad which ended in 2018, genomic sequencing of isolates from HEV cases reported in South Sudan showed HEV genotype 1 sub-genotype 1e, that was closely related to strains isolated in Chad and Uganda.&nbsp;",
2023-DON434,2023-DON434,2023-DON434,Assessment,"This is the first reported case of human infection caused by avian influenza A(H5) virus in Ecuador and in Latin America and the Caribbean. This human case was exposed to poultry, which died without apparent cause. Outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza have been detected recently in the provinces of Cotopaxi (influenza A(H5N1)) and Bol&iacute;var, Ecuador. Whenever avian influenza viruses are circulating in poultry, there is a risk for sporadic infection and small clusters of human cases due to exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments. Therefore, human cases are expected, although rare. According to the information received thus far, the virus has not been detected in other individuals beyond this single case. While further characterization of the virus from this case is pending, currently available epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that influenza A(H5) viruses have not acquired the ability for sustained transmission among humans, thus the likelihood of human-to-human spread is low. Based on available information, WHO assesses the risk to the general population posed by this virus to be low. The risk assessment will be reviewed as needed should further epidemiological or virological information become available.A global risk assessment associated with recent influenza A(H5N1) clade 2.3.4.4b viruses was published on 21 December 2022. However, the subtype and clade information for this human case is not yet known. There are no approved vaccines for preventing influenza A(H5) in humans. Candidate vaccines to prevent influenza A(H5) infection in humans have been developed for pandemic preparedness purposes. Close analysis of the epidemiological situation, further characterization of the most recent viruses (human and poultry) and serological investigations are critical to assess associated risk and to adjust risk management measures in a timely manner.",
2023-DON433,2023-DON433,2023-DON433,Assessment,"The outbreak is declared over, with no new cases reported for 42 consecutive days.This outbreak is not unexpected given that SVD is enzootic, present in animal reservoirs in the region.&nbsp; Uganda reported four SVD outbreaks in 2000, 2011, and two in 2012 prior to this last one in 2022, in addition to two Ebola outbreaks caused by the Zaire ebolavirus in 2007 and 2018. It is therefore likely that the filoviruses are present in the wild animal reservoir in the region. Thus, the risk of re-emergence of any filoviruses through exposure to an animal host or from a persistent virus cannot be excluded.This outbreak showed that re-emergence of SVD is a major public health concern in Uganda.&nbsp; Strengthening of surveillance capacities can help to detect future outbreaks preventing further spread.Ebola is a severe, often fatal illness affecting humans. While licensed therapeutics and vaccines are available, in limited numbers, to treat and prevent infections of Zaire ebolavirus, there are currently no licensed vaccines or therapeutics for SUDV.WHO considers that ongoing challenges in terms of epidemiological surveillance, infection prevention and control programs and practices in health care settings, coupled with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as ongoing outbreaks, such as Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF), Rift Valley fever, yellow fever, cholera, and measles, might jeopardize the country&rsquo;s ability to rapidly detect and respond to any re-emergence.",
2023-DON362,2023-DON362,2023-DON362,Assessment,"The emergence of cVDPV2 indicates gaps in routine immunization.&nbsp; It also highlights the importance of maintaining high levels of routine vaccination coverage everywhere to minimize the risk and consequences of the circulation of any poliovirus, as well as the need to ensure quality surveillance for early detection of any poliovirus.Furthermore, extensive population movement within country and across the borders coupled with sub optimal population immunity due to low vaccination coverage increase the risk of disease spreading across the country.",
2022-DON431,2022-DON431,2022-DON431,Assessment,"Between 26 August 2022 and 29 November 2022, there have been 22 additional confirmed cases of yellow fever reported from ten countries. However, based on retrospective classification of the cases, there were only seven new confirmed cases and one death. Countries including Burkina Faso, Senegal and Togo have reported probable cases that were subsequently discarded, indicating that there is enhanced surveillance put in place. However, there is still persistent yellow fever virus circulation, as several of the recent confirmations have been from locations with little or no underlying immunity (e.g., near urban areas in Cameroon and Uganda; areas with no history of yellow fever vaccination such as Isiolo county, Kenya) hard-to-reach and under-served populations, including children that have been disproportionately impacted. Based on the current situation of yellow fever in the WHO African region, the risk at the regional level was re-assessed as moderate on 12 December 2022 (high in November 2021 and June 2022) due to: 1. The decrease in the number of reported cases and the increasing population immunity, since there are ongoing and recent preventive vaccination campaigns, as well as reactive campaigns that have been organized in the affected countries, with more than four million people vaccinated in five countries (Ghana, Cameroon, Chad, the Central African Republic and Kenya), and an estimated 50 million people immunized during the PMVCs in 2021-2022 (Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Republic of the Congo) supported by the EYE Strategy. 2. There is ongoing yellow fever virus circulation in some high-risk areas, the most recent cases, and outbreaks are reported in areas impacted by underlying risk factors, including gaps in routine immunization, missed special populations (e.g., nomadic or pastoralists and other mobile populations), security and access challenges. 3. Most confirmed cases were reported in the last quarter of 2021, however several of the recent confirmations have been from urban areas and/or locations with little or no underlying immunity (e.g., near urban areas in Cameroon and Uganda; areas with no history of yellow fever vaccination); 4. Case classifications, and response operations remain a challenge; 5. Delays in detection and investigation; delays in the implementation of previously planned PMVC, competing outbreaks and pandemics of COVID-19 and Mpox that are attracting more attention in yellow fever-affected countries, and security constraints in affected areas (the Central African Republic, far North of Cameroon, Eastern - the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Northern Nigeria), population movement, all present risks that could lead to new yellow fever transmission.The overall global risk remains low, as no cases related to this current outbreak have been reported at this stage outside of the African region. However, there are favorable ecosystems for yellow fever outside the African region, especially in the neigbouring countries in the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region. There might be challenges in surveillance and immunization capacities due to the potential onward transmission through viremic travellers and due to the presence of the competent vector, if not detected in a timely way.The impact on public health will persist until the ongoing outbreaks are controlled, vaccination coverage is high and immunity gaps in the population are closed. The importation of cases to countries with suboptimal coverage and persisting population immunity gaps poses a high risk and may jeopardize the tremendous efforts invested to achieve elimination.",
2022-DON430,2022-DON430,2022-DON430,Assessment,"WHO assesses the risk to be high at the national level due to low polio vaccination coverage in Aceh and other provinces in Indonesia, the susceptibility of the population to poliovirus type 2 after switching from trivalent oral polio vaccine (tOVP) to bOPV in April 2016 combined with low uptake of inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), sub-optimal surveillance capacity, and vaccine hesitancy among the at-risk population. The detection of cVDPVs highlights the importance of maintaining high levels of routine vaccination coverage everywhere to minimize the risk and consequences of the circulation of any poliovirus, as well as the need to ensure quality surveillance for early detection of any poliovirus.&nbsp;",
2022-DON426,2022-DON426,2022-DON426,Assessment,"On 26 October 2022, WHO assessed the risk of cholera at the global level as very high, remaining a global threat to public health and an indicator of inequity and lack of social development. There has been an increase in global reported cholera outbreaks with 29 countries, mainly in the WHO African and Eastern Mediterranean Regions, reporting outbreaks to WHO in 2022 with many of those reporting higher case numbers and case fatality ratios (CFR) than in previous years. Several countries are in the midst of complex humanitarian crises with fragile health systems, inadequate access to clean water and sanitation, and insufficient capacity to respond to these outbreaks. Climate change and lack of development also contribute to outbreaks, and cross-border population movements. The latter, along with increased global travel following the COVID-19 pandemic, further increase the risk of international spread.The number of outbreaks occurring simultaneously across all WHO Regions is straining the overall epidemic response capacity. Protracted outbreaks of cholera are draining public health response personnel and depleting resources. Due to the global shortage of OCV, the ICG recently made the unprecedented decision to temporarily suspend the second dose strategy for the outbreak response. There are also significant delays and shortages of medical supplies that can lead to preventable and avoidable deaths.",

2022-DON427,2022-DON427,2022-DON427,Assessment,"The current cholera outbreak in Haiti, combined with the ongoing crisis related to gang violence, social unrest, and insecurity, has strained the health system&rsquo;s response capacity. The overall risk for this outbreak in Hispaniola is assessed as very high, due to the following reasons:The current socio-economic      situation, ongoing humanitarian crisis, food insecurity and poor health conditions are      affecting a large proportion of the population, leaving them vulnerable to      the risk of cholera infection and recurrence of cholera. Limited access of the general      population to safe drinking water and to sanitation facilities.Due to violence and insecurity, the      public health system and international partners have limited human      resources in Haiti, reducing the capacity to respond.Logistics issues, lack of access to      fuel and insecurity lead to difficulties to import supplies and challenges      to access the affected areas. Therefore, timely assessment of the      epidemiological situation is complex. Additionally, for the same reasons      the shipment of biological samples from healthcare facilities to reference      laboratories is hampered. These challenges further increase the risk of      undetected cases and delayed response efforts. The insecurity and access      to fuel hinders the population's access to health care, leading to delayed      treatment and potentially severe outcome.Considering the magnitude and wide spread of the cholera epidemic that is ongoing in Haiti, in conjunction with the complex humanitarian crisis the country is currently facing, the limited resources to control the epidemic, as well as the constant migration flows towards the Dominican Republic, the risk in Hispaniola is assessed as very high.In the Region of the Americas, considering the constant migration flow from Haiti to the countries and territories of the Region of the Americas, the heterogeneous capacity of the States Parties to detect and respond to cholera outbreaks, as well as the burnout of health workers from concurrent public health emergencies, the regional risk is assessed as moderate.The risk posed by the event on the Island of Hispaniola (Haiti and the Dominican Republic) at the global level is assessed as low.WHO will continue to evaluate the epidemiological situation.",

2022-DON424,2022-DON424,2022-DON424,Assessment,"Bangladesh experienced a moderate rainfall during October this year which was unusual (monsoon is from May to September). Due to the untimely rainfall and favorable climate conditions, the density of the Aedes mosquito population is increasing. In addition, many people keep water in different containers like buckets and pots in their houses, enabling Aedes mosquitos to readily breed in such artificial collections of water. A pre-monsoon survey carried out by the health directorate earlier this year found a higher density of Aedes mosquitoes in the capital compared to 2021. Experts in the Communicable Disease Control (CDC) unit of the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) predicted a worsening dengue situation this year in Dhaka city unless preventive steps were taken. The CDC unit revealed its most recent monsoon survey in September and found that mosquito density was twice as high in Dhaka city as in the pre-monsoon survey.Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection caused by four dengue virus serotypes (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, DENV-4). The predominant currently circulating serotype in Bangladesh is unknown at this stage, but limited serotyping has detected dengue virus 3 (DENV-3) and dengue virus 4 (DENV-4). DENV-3 has been consistently predominant since 2019 but DEN-4 has not been reported for several years. Dengue virus has the potential to cause epidemics resulting in high morbidity and mortality. There is no specific treatment. However, early recognition of dengue virus infection and appropriate clinical management can reduce disease severity and mortality among dengue patients. At present, the number of severe dengue cases and case-fatality rates appear to be increasing, likely due to late health-seeking behaviour and access issues. With the receding COVID-19 pandemic, the travel restrictions have been lifted. This has led to the movement of people to and from Dhaka. Although there have been concerted efforts by the Local Government Engineering Department (LGED), City Corporations, and the Ministry of Health towards curbing the dengue outbreak in Dhaka in the past few months, yet the continued movements have led to an inflow of possibly infected individuals with a potential to contribute to dengue transmission cycles. Vector control activities have been less intense in the other districts of Bangladesh. Dengue poses a significant public health concern for Bangladesh which experiences regular seasonal outbreaks of dengue. Furthermore, the clinical management of people who develop severe illnesses, often requiring hospital care, puts additional strain on an already overburdened healthcare system.&nbsp;",

2022-DON422,2022-DON422,2022-DON422,Assessment,"Between September 2012 and 17 October 2022, the total number of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection cases reported globally to WHO is 2600 with 935 associated deaths. Most of these cases have occurred in countries in the Arabian Peninsula. There has been one large outbreak outside of the Middle East in May 2015, during which 186 laboratory-confirmed cases (185 in the Republic of Korea and 1 in China) and 38 deaths were reported, however, the index case in that outbreak had a travel history to the Middle East. The global number reflects the total number of laboratory-confirmed cases reported to WHO under IHR (2005) to date. The total number of deaths includes the deaths that WHO is aware of to date through follow-up with affected Member States.The notification of the four cases does not change the overall risk assessment. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East and/or other countries where MERS-CoV is circulating in dromedaries, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who were exposed to the virus through contact with dromedaries or their products (for example, consumption of camel&rsquo;s raw milk), or in a healthcare setting. WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessments based on the latest available information.&nbsp; The number of MERS-CoV cases reported to WHO has substantially declined since the beginning of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This is likely the result of epidemiological surveillance activities for COVID-19 being prioritized, resulting in reduced testing and detection of MERS-CoV cases. In addition, measures taken during the COVID-19 pandemic to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission (e.g. mask-wearing, hand hygiene, physical distancing, improving the ventilation of indoor spaces, respiratory etiquette, stay-at-home orders, reduced mobility) are also likely reduce opportunities for onward human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV. However, the circulation of MERS-CoV in dromedary camels is not likely to have been impacted by these measures. Therefore, while the number of reported secondary cases of MERS has been reduced, the risk of zoonotic transmission remains.",

2022-DON423,2022-DON423,2022-DON423,Assessment,"On 1 November 2022, WHO revised the risk assessment for this event from high to very high at the national level, and from low to high at the regional level, while the risk remained low at the global level.The estimated very high risk at the national level is based on a combination of several factors including the lack of licensed medical countermeasures; the late detection of the SUDV outbreak and its spread to multiple districts (including to larger cities like Kampala, with a population of more than four million people and travel connections to many neighbouring countries); a highly mobile population with reports of some high-risk contacts and symptomatic cases traveling between districts using public transportation; despite significant case-finding efforts, there is a possibility that some contacts may have been missed; reported challenges with community engagement in affected districts; many cases have presented at various health facilities with suboptimal infection prevention and control (IPC) practices.The current outbreak is the first outbreak of Sudan ebolavirus in Uganda since 2012. Uganda has developed an increased capacity to respond to Ebola outbreaks over recent years and has a local capacity mobilized and organized with available resources to provide a robust response, but the system could be overwhelmed if the number of cases continues to rise and the outbreak spreads to other densely populated districts, as the country is simultaneously responding to multiple emergencies including outbreaks of anthrax, COVID-19, Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic Fever, Rift Valley fever and yellow fever, as well as prevailing food insecurity.At the regional level, the risk has been assessed as high due to the lack of licensed vaccines and therapeutics, mass population movements within and across neighbouring countries, along with weak cross-border surveillance that further amplifies the risk of disease spread, and health systems that respond to multiple emergencies.The risk will be continuously assessed based on available and shared information.",
2022-DON419,2022-DON419,2022-DON419,Assessment,"Cholera is endemic in Malawi with seasonal outbreaks occurring during the wet season. The first major outbreak occurred in 1998 and was widespread in the southern region, with 25 000 cases reported. The country reported its largest outbreak occurring from October 2001 to April 2002, which affected 26 of the 29 districts, with 33 546 cases and 968 deaths (CFR 3%). A more recent outbreak occurred in 2019 &ndash; 2020 with a total of 26 cases and one death. Since the beginning of 2022, 27 districts have reported cholera cases. The outbreak was largely confined to the south of the country, including the areas affected by the cyclones until after July 2022, when the outbreak spread to the North of the country resulting in a surge in cases. This upsurge in the number of cases is being reported during the country&rsquo;s dry season when normally there is low or no transmission of cholera in Malawi. The upcoming rainy season in November poses the threat of further disease spread nationwide.There is a continued risk for further increases in the number of cases and international spread. Confirmed cases had been reported across the border in Mozambique during the initial period of the current outbreak. In late September, a cholera outbreak was declared in Lago district in Mozambique which borders Malawi (through Lake Malawi). Currently, the most affected districts in Malawi are in the Northern part of the country some of which are on the border with Tanzania and Zambia. There is significant cross-border movement in the region with bordering countries and beyond. Given the history of cross-border spread of cholera during this outbreak, WHO considers the risk of further spread of the disease very high at national and regional level.",

2022-DON417,2022-DON417,2022-DON417,Assessment,"RVF is not unusual in Mauritania. The country previously experienced outbreaks in 1987, 2010, 2012, 2015 and 2020. Transmission can occur through carrier mosquito bites, contact with contaminated blood or tissues, and during the slaughter of animals. Confirmation of virus circulation in animals from several areas the majority of wilayas presents a significant risk of amplifying the disease in humans.The precarious environmental conditions, inadequate sanitation services in the affected localities, and high animal density contribute to the proliferation of vectors and the spread of the virus. The abundant rainfall recorded this year and flooding in most of these wilayas, combined with the dumping of waste tires, used containers and garbage, enhances the proliferation of vector breeding sites.The risk of spread at the regional level is moderate. Mauritania is an agro-pastoral country, and the movement of animals in search of water and pasture increases the risk of disease spread. Recurrent cross-border pastoral movements increase the risk of regional spread of the disease into neighboring countries. Fourteen of Mauritania&rsquo;s 15 wilayas have reported either confirmed human, confirmed animal or suspected animal cases[2], of which nine border Mali, Senegal or Algeria; specifically, the wilayas of Assaba, Adrar, Hodh El Chargui, Hodh El Gharbi, Guidimakha and Tiris Zemmour border Mali; the wilayas of Brakna, Gorgal, Guidimakha and Trarza border Senegal, and the wilaya of Tiris Zemmour borders Algeria. Moreover, RVF is not among the diseases subject to vaccination control of cattle at the borders; and transhumance&mdash; a practice characterized by pastoralism and movement of livestock under the care of herders &mdash;is frequent within Mauritania and across the borders into Mali and Senegal. Livestock markets in some countries in the sub-region are supplied from Mauritania.The global risk is estimated to be low.",
2022-DON416,2022-DON416,2022-DON416,Assessment,"Lebanon&rsquo;s health system has been hard-hit by a three-year financial crisis and an explosion at the port of Beirut in August 2020 that destroyed essential medical infrastructure in the capital. In this context, responding to a cholera outbreak may overwhelm the already fragile health system in the country.According to The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), Lebanon hosts the largest number of refugees in the world per capita and square kilometre, with 1.5 million Syrian refugees and about 13 715 refugees of other nationalities. Additionally, there is a large population of Palestinian refugees that are particularly exposed due to unsafe WASH services in various camps (Beqaa, Trablos, Beirut, Saida, Sour), possibly with limited medical services provided.Due to porous borders allowing free movement between Lebanon and neighbouring countries, the exportation of cholera cases is highly likely.The current cholera outbreak in Lebanon was reported six weeks after a cholera outbreak was declared in neighbouring Syria. On 15 September 2022, WHO assessed the risk of the cholera outbreak in Syria and predicted that due to shortages of drinking water and a fragile and limited health system in Lebanon, there was a risk of a cholera outbreak should the disease be introduced into the country. Power cuts, water shortages, and inflation have strained the already fragile health system in Lebanon. Poverty has also worsened for many Lebanese, with many families frequently rationing water, unable to afford private water tanks for consumption and domestic use.Since the last cholera outbreak in Lebanon occurred in 1993, there is a need to update cholera surveillance and case management guidelines and re-train healthcare workers.",
2022-DON413,2022-DON413,2022-DON413,Assessment,"Malaria is one of the leading causes of illness and death in Pakistan. Intense transmission occurs mainly in districts located in regions bordering the Islamic Republic of Iran and Afghanistan and along the coastal belt in Sindh and Balochistan provinces. In addition, there is high population movement between Pakistan and its border countries (Afghanistan and the Islamic Republic of Iran), particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province with over 1 million Afghani refugees. Of these, nearly 800 000 refugees live in districts officially notified as calamity hit by floods, therefore the risk of international spread of the disease cannot be ruled out.Over 33 million people have been affected by the floods and 81 districts have been declared as calamity hit. The health infrastructure was also damaged with rapid assessments indicating some 1543 health facilities and their contents have been damaged.Given the current situation in Pakistan and limited access to health facilities and insufficient healthcare workers and essential medical supplies, there is an increased risk of serious health impacts from malaria and other ongoing outbreaks including COVID-19, acute watery diarrhoea, typhoid, measles, leishmaniasis, HIV, and polio. The risk is assessed as very high considering the current flood crisis affecting the capacity of the national health system. Many challenges to response measures surfaced when some flood-affected districts reported a doubling in incidence rates, a high P. falciparum ratio, and limited stocks of emergency medicines, insecticides and supplies accompanied with a long lead time for procurement. The lack of resources to adequately scale-up precautionary vector-control measures will certainly increase the spread of malaria and other vector-borne diseases.",
2022-DON414,2022-DON414,2022-DON414,Assessment,"Pakistan is experiencing an abnormal monsoon rainfall and unprecedented floods. One-third of the country and an estimated 33 million people have been impacted in 84 calamity declared districts. More than 2 million houses have been destroyed and an estimated 1460 health facilities have also reportedly been damaged. Some 7.9 million people are reportedly displaced, 12 900 people injured, and 1600 people have died. Heavy rains and floods have left millions of people without access to healthcare and medical treatment.With the current flood crisis affecting the national health system capacity, there is a high risk of serious health impacts from dengue fever.&nbsp; Currently, there is a need for improved vector surveillance, enhanced laboratory capacity for better detection, sensitization of health care providers on case management (including warning signs of severe dengue) and improved surveillance of acute febrile illness to better define disease burden and seasonality patterns. Vector-borne epidemics &ndash; including dengue &ndash; after flooding is a well-known phenomenon, as the stagnant water provides favorable habitats for mosquitoes to breed. The lag time is usually around 3-4 weeks before the occurrence of dengue cases.Ongoing disease outbreaks in Pakistan, including acute watery diarrhoea, dengue, malaria, measles, polio, and COVID-19 are being further aggravated, particularly in internally displaced persons and refugee camps and where water and sanitation facilities have been damaged.Dengue fever is the most rapidly spreading mosquito-borne virus infection in the world. There is high population movement between Pakistan&mdash;in particular, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province&mdash; and bordering countries, especially the Islamic Republic of Iran and Afghanistan. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province is also home to 1 200 000 Afghani refugees, of which 800 000 live in districts officially notified as calamity hit by floods.

2022-DON415,2022-DON415,2022-DON415,Assessment,"The current cholera outbreak in Haiti, combined with the ongoing crisis related to gang violence, social unrest, and insecurity, has strained the health system&rsquo;s response capacity. In addition, the country is highly vulnerable and at risk of natural hazards, which have exacerbated previous humanitarian crises.The overall risk assessed for this outbreak is very high at the national level, due to the following reasons:The current socio-economic situation, ongoing humanitarian crisis and poor health conditions are affecting a large proportion of the population leaving them vulnerable to the risk of cholera infection and recurrence of cholera. &nbsp;In the affected areas of Port-au-Prince metropolitan area and southern departments, there are 24 200 internally displaced people&nbsp;who have been displaced due to gang violence.Limited access of the general population to safe drinking water and to sanitation facilities.Due to the insecurity, the public health system and international partners have limited human resources in Haiti, reducing the capacity to respond.Logistics issues and lack of access to fuel and insecurity lead to difficulties to import supplies and challenges to access the affected areas. Therefore, timely assessment of the epidemiological situation is complex. Additionally, for the same reasons the shipment of biological samples from healthcare facilities to reference laboratories could also be hampered.The risk at the regional level is assessed as moderate, due to the following reasons:Since 2010, confirmed cases of cholera have predominantly been reported from Haiti, followed by the Dominican Republic, Cuba, and Mexico. Sporadic imported cases have also been reported in other countries in the Region. However, there is greater capacity in other countries to detect and control outbreaks of cholera. Neighboring Dominican Republic which is likely the most at risk of an increase in cases, has the capacity to detect and control cholera.The risk at the global level was assessed as low.WHO will continue to evaluate the epidemiological situation in Haiti.",
2022-DON412,2022-DON412,2022-DON412,Assessment,"Nepal reported its first dengue case in a traveller returning from India in 2004. Since then, dengue has been endemic in Nepal. The country has expertise and experience in managing dengue, however, WHO considers the overall risk for the current dengue outbreak high at the national level due to the following reasons: As dengue is recurrent in the country, the population may be at risk of re-infection and therefore,&nbsp;serious complications may occur if not managed promptly and correctly.&nbsp; At present, severe dengue cases and case-fatality rates appear to be increasing, likely due to the limited hospital capacity in-country and limited access to and use of health care services. With the current increase in other vector-borne diseases in Nepal this year, such as Japanese Encephalitis and Scrub typhus, affecting&nbsp;the national health system capacity, there is a high risk of serious health impacts from dengue fever. Dengue virus has the potential to cause epidemics resulting in high morbidity and mortality.&nbsp; There is no specific treatment. Early recognition of dengue virus infection and appropriate clinical management can reduce the severity of disease and mortality among dengue patients.The current circulating serotype is unknown at this stage, although further laboratory tests are planned. Infection with one serotype provides long-term immunity to the homologous serotype, however, the risk for severe dengue is high in a second infection with a different DENV serotype.Current data suggests that dengue cases are increasing in magnitude and expanding out of the lowland areas typically suitable for the breeding of Aedes mosquitoes to higher elevations, potentially due to climate changes and rapid urbanization.This outbreak underscores the need for improved vector surveillance, enhanced laboratory capacity for better case detection, and improved&nbsp;surveillance of acute febrile illness in Nepal to effectively control the outbreak.&nbsp;There is frequent population movement across the Nepal-India land border. Dengue is endemic in many parts of India including northern Indian States, which share the border with Nepal.&nbsp; Given the high incidence in Nepal, it is possible that dengue may spread across the border into India, although its consequences may depend on a number of factors such as the density of vectors, circulating serotypes, and level of public health response in the neighbouring Indian states. Nepal is a popular tourist destination, hence, spread through international travellers cannot be ruled out as Nepal is easing international travel restrictions imposed in response to COVID-19.",
2022-DON411,2022-DON411,2022-DON411,Assessment,"This latest EVD outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is declared over, with no new cases reported for 42 days after the burial of the last and only confirmed case on 16 August 2022. This case is genetically linked to the 2018-2020 outbreak in North Kivu, Ituri and South Kivu provinces. (For more information on this outbreak, please see the WHO outbreak account related to the 2018-2020 event). The source of this most recent outbreak has not yet been identified.A future outbreak is not unexpected given that EVD is endemic in the country. Ebola virus is enzootic and a resurgence from viral persistence in survivors described in recent epidemics. Re-emergence of EVD is a major public health concern in the Democratic Republic of the Congo; gaps remain in the country's capacity to recover, prepare for, and respond to outbreaks. The concurrent outbreaks in the country (COVID-19, cholera, measles, polio, yellow fever, monkeypox, etc) as well as the protracted humanitarian situation in the Eastern part of the country have put increasing pressure on the health system and the available resources.A confluence of environmental and socioeconomic factors &mdash; including community mistrust, weak health systems, and political instability &mdash; in some specific areas such as North Kivu province can increase the risk for new outbreaks of EVD. Moreover, improved capacities in detection, laboratory confirmation and increased surveillance may explain the increased frequency in detecting EVD outbreaks. Nevertheless, WHO is concerned that ongoing challenges regarding insecurity as well as health system challenges (epidemiological surveillance, IPC programmes and practices in health care settings), coupled with the emergence of COVID-19 and other ongoing outbreaks, may jeopardize the country's ability to rapidly detect and respond to any re-emergence.",

2022-DON410,2022-DON410,2022-DON410,Assessment,"Uganda has experience in responding to Ebola virus disease and Sudan virus disease outbreaks, and necessary action has been initiated quickly. The current outbreak is the first Ebola disease outbreak caused by Sudan virus in Uganda since 2012.&nbsp; In the absence of licensed vaccines and therapeutics for prevention and treatment of Sudan virus disease, the risk of potential serious public health impact is high. Community deaths and care of patients in private facilities and hospitals and other community health services with limited protection and infection prevention and control measures entail a high risk of many transmission chains. Investigations are ongoing to determine the scope of the outbreak and the possibility of spreading to other districts. Importation of cases to neighbouring countries cannot be ruled out at this stage.According to the information currently available, the overall risk has been assessed as high at national level considering: (i) the confirmed Sudan virus and the lack of an authorized vaccine (ii) the possibility that the event started three weeks before the identification of the index case and several transmission chains &nbsp;have not been &nbsp;not tracked; (iii) patients presented at various facilities with suboptimal infection, prevention and control (IPC) practices including inadequate use of personal protective equipment (PPE); the patients died and were traditionally buried with large gathering ceremonies; (iv) although the country has developed an increased capacity to respond to Ebola outbreaks over recent years, and has a local capacity that can be easily mobilized and organised with&nbsp; available resources to mount a robust response, the system could be overwhelmed if&nbsp; the number of cases increases and the outbreak spreads to other sub-counties, districts and regions, as the country simultaneously responds to multiple&nbsp; emergencies, including anthrax, COVID-19, Rift Valley fever and Yellow fever, as well as flooding and prevailing food insecurity.In addition, the outbreak was detected among individuals living around an active local gold mine. Mobility among traders of this commodity is likely to be high, and the declaration of the outbreak may cause some miners already incubating the disease to flee.The currently affected Mubende district has no international borders. Nevertheless, the risk of international spread cannot be ruled out due to the active cross-border population movement. In addition, investigations are ongoing to establish transmission chains and the scope of the outbreak is yet to be determined.At Regional and Global levels, the overall risk has been assessed as low.",

The detection of this VDPV2 strain underscores the importance of;&nbsp;&nbsp;&bull;	maintaining high levels of routine polio vaccination coverage at all levels and in all communities to minimize the risk and consequences of any poliovirus circulation.&nbsp;&bull;	having sensitive surveillance systems for the timely detection of VDPV importation or VDPV emergence.&nbsp;Based on the WHO UNICEF estimates, the vaccine coverage for three routine doses of polio vaccine evaluated in children aged 12 months in the United Kingdom and United States of America were 93% and 92% respectively in 2021.WHO will continue to support the ongoing investigation, risk assessment and outbreak response by national authorities.&nbsp;&nbsp;",
2022-DON407,2022-DON407,2022-DON407,Assessment,"Legionellosis varies in severity from a mild febrile illness to a serious and sometimes fatal form of pneumonia and is caused by exposure to&nbsp;Legionella&nbsp;species found in contaminated water and potting mixes. The most common form of transmission of&nbsp;Legionellosis&nbsp;is inhalation of contaminated aerosols from contaminated water sources. Sources that have been linked to both the transmission of&nbsp;Legionella&nbsp;via aerosols and outbreaks of Legionellosis include air conditioning cooling towers or evaporative condensers associated with air conditioning and industrial cooling, hot and cold water systems, humidifiers, and whirlpool spas. Infection can also occur by aspiration of contaminated water or ice, particularly in susceptible hospital patients. To date, there is no reported direct human-to-human transmission.Sporadic outbreaks of legionellosis pneumonia have been reported in Argentina before. There are robust surveillance activities being implemented in the affected health facility. Nonetheless, in the absence of an identified source of Legionella bacteria, the risk of developing Legionellosis for people working or hospitalized at the same health facility is currently moderate.Countries with cases of Legionellosis reported after travel to Argentina should notify their regional IHR focal point.",
2022-DON405,2022-DON405,2022-DON405,Assessment,"According to the EYE strategy, twenty-seven countries in the African region are high-risk countries for yellow fever based on timing and intensity of yellow fever virus transmission, transmission potential and assessment of urban risk. Re-emergence of yellow fever was reported in 2020 with two outbreaks in West African countries with history of mass vaccination (in Guinea and Senegal, now contained). Since late 2021, the situation has intensified with 12 countries across the region reporting probable and confirmed cases.&nbsp;&nbsp;WHO assesses the risk at regional level to be high. Current multi-country outbreaks and active virus circulation in West, Central and East Africa have resulted in increased morbidity and mortality, with continued risk of amplification and spread. The immunization coverage for yellow fever has been suboptimal in most of the affected countries and in specific populations. According to WHO and UNICEF estimates, in 2021, the routine childhood vaccination immunization coverage for yellow fever in the African region was 47%. This is much lower than the 80% threshold required to confer population immunity against yellow fever, indicating that a large population remains susceptible to yellow fever with a risk of continued transmission.&nbsp;Immunization coverage by countries reporting probable and confirmed cases in West, Central and East Africa are as follows: Cameroon (54%), Central African Republic (41%), Chad (45%), Republic of the Congo (67%), C&ocirc;te d&rsquo;Ivoire (65%), Democratic Republic of the Congo (56%), Gabon (53%), Ghana (94%), Kenya (7%), Niger (80%), and Nigeria (63%). Uganda plans to introduce yellow fever vaccine into routine immunization in August 2022. Further information on immunization coverage can be found here.&nbsp;Many countries in West, Central, and East Africa have been facing political instability and insecurity, in addition to concurrent outbreaks (including COVID-19, Ebola virus disease, cholera, meningitis, malaria, monkeypox, circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2), chikungunya, leishmaniasis, plague, Lassa fever, etc.). These could contribute to delayed case investigation and hinder the surveillance and response efforts against yellow fever.&nbsp;&nbsp;The risk at global level is assessed to be low as no exported cases of yellow fever linked to these 12 countries with probable or confirmed cases since January 2021 have been reported.",
2022-DON404,2022-DON404,2022-DON404,Assessment,"Preliminary information indicates that the first case was hospitalized at the health facility for 23 days without being diagnosed with EVD and died before EVD was confirmed by the laboratory. There is a risk of spread of EVD in the Province, and infection among health workers and co-patients in the health facility where the case was admitted.The current resurgence is not unexpected given that EVD is endemic in the country and Ebola virus is present in animal reservoirs in the region. The virus can persist in some bodily fluids of EVD survivors. &nbsp;In a limited number of cases, secondary transmissions resulting from exposure to body fluids of EVD survivors have been documented. Relapses in EVD survivors have been reported. &nbsp;Moreover, the frequent detection of outbreaks in recent years can also be explained by new developments in Ebola control, such as the use of GeneXpert machines, as well as the strengthening of surveillance and detection following successive epidemics and the scaling up of Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR).The re-emergence of EVD is a major public health concern in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and there are still gaps in the country's capacity to recover, prepare and respond to outbreaks.The Beni area is also affected by insecurity from armed groups. There have been more frequent protests against the security measures put in place by the authorities and against the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO), which further increases the risk of refusal of outbreak control measures and therefore the possibility of spread of the disease. The concurrent outbreaks in the country (COVID-19, cholera, measles, polio, yellow fever, monkeypox, etc) as well as the protracted humanitarian situation in the province of North Kivu, have put increasing pressure on the health system and the available resources. The risk at the national level is assessed as high. The risk at the regional and global levels is assessed as moderate and low, respectively. WHO is closely monitoring the situation and the risk assessment will be updated as new information becomes available.",
2022-DON403,2022-DON403,2022-DON403,Assessment,"WHO assesses the overall risk at the national level as moderate. Although the exact source of the outbreak remains unidentified, it is likely linked to farming activities. The affected areas attract farmers from other locations who make temporary settlements while farming and the area has a seasonal influx of farmers, inferring that many other people can be exposed to the same source of contamination and the number of cases may increase. In addition, the affected areas have limited basic services including water supply, sanitation and hygiene, and health care services. It is therefore anticipated that IPC capacities at the community level would be weak. Moreover, the country&rsquo;s capacity to respond to this outbreak might become overwhelmed, if the number of cases and affected areas increase in addition to other ongoing health threats. Leptospirosis has been previously reported in the United Republic of Tanzania (2014, in Kigoma Region) and is a recognized public health risk. However, the incidence in different regions is not well known and surveillance capacity is limited.  The risk of disease spread both at regional and global levels is considered Low.",
2022-DON401,2022-DON401,2022-DON401,Assessment,"In August 2017, approximately 700,000 Rohingya nationals fled from Myanmar to Cox&rsquo;s Bazar district, joining more than 200,000 Rohingya nationals already present, and settling into informal makeshift camps, marked by inadequate access to potable water or quality sanitation and challenging living conditions. The speed and magnitude of the influx exerted pressure on existing resources, strained healthcare services, water, and other social amenities. As a result, there have been high levels of global acute malnutrition (GAM) in children under five years; persistent transmission of acute watery diarrhoea (AWD); recurrent cholera epidemics that are transitioning into an endemic state; persistent diphtheria transmission since 2017; and occasional upsurges of measles, varicella, and skin infections. Dengue virus has the potential to cause epidemics resulting in high morbidity and mortality.&nbsp; In Bangladesh, hospital capacity is limited and further increases in severe dengue cases may pose considerable challenges in case management. The Severe Acute Respiratory Infections Treatment Centres (SARI ITC) bed occupancy for COVID-19 admissions is 26% as of 26 June. As hospitals become burdened with people affected by the COVID-19 virus, the increase in hospitalized dengue cases may put undue strain on healthcare capacities. Currently, the district of Cox&rsquo;s Bazar can detect dengue using RDTs done in approximately 50 sentinel sites distributed across the 33 camps located in Ukhia and Teknaf Upazilas (sub-districts). There is currently no capacity for dengue virus serotyping at Cox&rsquo;s Bazar Medical College Laboratory.  Cox&rsquo;s Bazar previously experienced an acute dengue outbreak from October to December 2021. The current surge in dengue cases could be considered a continuation of last year&rsquo;s transmission. As dengue is recurrent in this part of the country, the population may be at risk of a secondary infection that may lead to serious complications if not treated promptly and adequately. Key challenges experienced during last year&rsquo;s dengue upsurge included delays in the international procurement process for dengue RDT kits, the long process necessary for undertaking dengue virus serotype in the capital Dhaka given such capacity is not available in Cox&rsquo;s Bazar, and weak vector surveillance and control.  In addition to the COVID-19 pandemic, other ongoing health events such as cholera/AWD (persistent low level of transmission) and diphtheria (persistent low level of transmission since September 2021) may pose additional challenges in response measures by competing for resources.&nbsp; Population movement is now more pronounced in Bangladesh with the relaxation of COVID19-related movement restrictions. Cox&rsquo;s Bazar does not have a direct international point of entry. However, it is close to the seaport in Chattogram and has a domestic airport that receives a large volume of local and international tourists and international humanitarian workers. These factors increase the possibility of international dengue introduction and spread.",
2019-DON403,2019-DON403,2019-DON403,Assessment,"Yellow fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic disease transmitted by infected mosquitoes and has the potential to spread rapidly and cause serious public health impact. There is no specific treatment, although the disease is preventable using a single dose of yellow fever vaccine, which provides immunity for life. Supportive care is required to treat dehydration, respiratory failure, and fever; and antibiotics are recommended to treat associated bacterial infections.The recent confirmation by the national reference laboratory of the yellow fever outbreak in Bauchi states linked with cases in three other states including Borno, Kano and Gombe represents a concerning situation in Nigeria.Given the scale of the outbreak in Bauchi and three other states, the national risk is assessed as high due to the potential for ongoing local transmission and amplification. Factors considered include the low vaccination coverage; probability of the presence of competent vectors including&nbsp;Aedes&nbsp;species; the potential spread to new LGAs, and the link of the outbreak to the game reserve in Alkaleri LGA, the most popular tourist destination in the country.There is currently a moderate risk at regional level due to the possible movement of the individuals of affected states to adjacent areas and neighbouring countries. The current overall risk is low at the global level.Nigeria is facing several concurrent public health emergencies, including circulating Vaccine Derived Polio Virus (cVDPV), measles, Lassa fever, and cholera outbreaks, and a humanitarian crisis in the northeast of the country.

The last assessment concluded that the national and regional risk levels remain very high, while global risk levels remain low. Weekly increases in the number of new cases were observed from February through mid-May 2019, with lower though still substantial rates since then. A general deterioration of the security situation, and the persistence of pockets of community mistrust exacerbated by political tensions and insecurity, especially over the past four weeks, have resulted in recurrent temporary suspension and delays of case investigation and response activities in affected areas, reducing the overall effectiveness of interventions.

In order to ensure staff safety and security, security mitigation measures are being enhanced, and procedural, operational, and physical security challenges are being addressed. The high proportion of community deaths reported among confirmed cases, relatively low proportion of new cases who were known contacts under surveillance, existence of transmission chains linked to nosocomial infection, persistent delays in detection and isolation in ETCs, and challenges in the timely reporting and response to probable cases, are all factors increasing the likelihood of further chains of transmission in affected communities and increasing the risk of geographical spread both within the Democratic Republic of the Congo and to neighbouring countries. The high rates of population movement occurring from outbreak affected areas to other areas of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and across porous borders to neighbouring countries during periods of heightened insecurity further compounds these risks. Additional risks are posed by the long duration of the current outbreak, fatigue amongst response staff, and ongoing strain on limited resources.

2019-DON183,2019-DON183,2019-DON183,Assessment,"The detection of cVDPVs underscores the importance of maintaining high routine vaccination coverage everywhere to minimize the risk and consequences of any poliovirus circulation as well as the need to ensure quality surveillance for early detection of any polioviruses. These events also underscore the risk posed by any low-level transmission of the virus. A robust outbreak response is needed to rapidly stop circulation and ensure sufficient vaccination coverage in the affected areas to prevent similar outbreaks in the future.For this event, the overall public health risk at national level is considered to be high due to:Low socio- economic conditions and limited public health infrastructure in some parts of Kayin stateAccumulated susceptible population due to low population immunity among specific Kayin state population, which poses a risk of ongoing transmission within and across the state.Hard-to-reach area with accessibility challenges due to security concerns, and geographical location which hamper the vaccination and the implementation of response actions.The low routine immunization coverage in the affected areas provides favourable conditions for the expansion of a possible polio virus outbreak across different areas in the country.The high number of nucleotide changes of the cVDPV1 isolates, the recent discovery of new cases and the evidence of healthy contacts being infected indicates that the virus may have been circulating for a long time, thus increasing the risk of spread.Although Kayin state met certification standard of AFP surveillance (2017-2018), there might be pockets of ongoing transmission which are not timely detected.The limited accessibility for health care providers in certain areas in Kayin state including the affected Hpapun township, which impedes the implementation of response measures.As per UNHCR, as of June 2019, 95,681 refugees from Myanmar, most of them belonging to ethnic minorities from Kayin state, are living in nine refugee camps in Thailand. The polio immunization coverage of Thailand is high, and a joint field visit conducted by WHO Country Office and MOH-Thailand following notification of cVDPV in Myanmar confirms that the coverage of OPV is 93.3% in these camps in 2018.WHO will continue to evaluate the epidemiological situation and outbreak response measures being implemented.&nbsp;",

2019-DON189,2019-DON189,2019-DON189,Assessment,"Yellow fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic disease transmitted by infected mosquitoes and has the potential to spread rapidly and cause serious public health impact. There is no specific treatment, although the disease is preventable using a single dose of yellow fever vaccine, which provides immunity for life. Supportive care is required to treat dehydration, respiratory failure, and fever; and antibiotics are recommended to treat associated bacterial infections.The recent confirmation by the national and regional reference laboratories of the Yellow fever cases in Ebonyi State, with the probable epicentre in Izzi LGA, represents a concerning situation in Nigeria.Given the rapid evolution of the situation in Ebonyi State, the national risk is assessed as high due to the high CFR (36%) and the potential for ongoing local transmission and amplification. Factors considered include the low vaccination coverage; probability of the presence of competent vectors including Aedes species; the proximity of a yellow fever case to Abakiliki LGA (an urban centre in the State); and the potential spread to new LGAs.There is currently a moderate risk at regional level due to the possible movement of the individuals of affected States to adjacent areas and neighbouring countries, particularly if there is arrival of unvaccinated visitors to the State.

Infection with one serotype provides long term immunity to the homologous serotype but not to the other serotypes. Sequential infections put people at greater risk for severe dengue and dengue shock syndrome (DSS).

There is no specific treatment, although the disease is preventable using a single dose of yellow fever vaccine, which provides immunity for life. Supportive care is required to treat dehydration, respiratory failure, and fever; and antibiotics are recommended to treat associated bacterial infections.The origin of the infection of this case is likely to be sylvatic, in an area determined as at risk for yellow fever.

2019-DON209,2019-DON209,2019-DON209,Assessment,"WHO continuously monitors changes to the epidemiological situation and context of the outbreak to ensure that support to the response is adapted to the evolving circumstances. The last assessment concluded that the national and regional risk levels remain very high, while global risk levels remain low.While the relatively lower case incidence observed is encouraging, it must be interpreted with caution as the situation remains highly contingent upon the level of access and security within affected communities. Concurrent with the decline in case incidence, there was a shift in hotspots from urban settings to more rural, hard-to-reach communities, within a more concentrated geographical area. These areas bring additional challenges to the response, including an extremely volatile security situation, difficulty accessing some remote areas, delays to engaging with the community which in turn lead to mistrust and misunderstandings, and potential under-reporting of cases. The recent security events and disruption of response activities underscore the fact that the risk of resurgence remains very high, as do the risks of re-dispersion of the outbreak with cases travelling outside of hotspots to seek healthcare or for other reasons. These risks continue to be mitigated by the substantial response and preparedness activities in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and neighbouring countries, with support from a consortium of international partners.",

Information on the circulating dengue virus serotypes in Sudan is not available. In this regard, more investigation on the dengue virus (DENV) needs to be conducted.The current dengue fever outbreak is coinciding with other ongoing outbreaks of chikungunya, rift valley fever, malaria, and cholera. Control and response capacities of the public health sector is limited; years of political and civil conflicts have reduced the country capacity to control and prevent outbreaks.Since the start of the outbreak on 8 August 2019, dengue has spread to seven states across the country. To date, five deaths have been reported. The high likelihood of co-infection with chikungunya and/or malaria complicates case management and may result in poor prognosis.The risk of international spread of dengue fever virus is high due to the presence of suitable mosquito vectors (Aedes&nbsp;) in the neighboring countries; which are also experiencing floods and seasonal heavy rains, as well as lack of effective vector control programs. Port Sudan, the capital of Red Sea State, is the most important port of the Red Sea with a high volume of international trade and traffic that could potentially lead to further international spread.&nbsp;",
2019-DON211,2019-DON211,2019-DON211,Assessment,"Measles is a highly contagious viral disease which affects susceptible individuals of all ages and remains one of the leading causes of death among young children globally, despite the availability of safe and effective measles-containing vaccines. It is transmitted via droplets from the nose, mouth, or throat of infected persons. Initial symptoms, which usually appear 10&ndash;12 days after infection, include high fever, usually accompanied by one or several of the following: runny nose, conjunctivitis, cough and tiny white spots on the inside of the mouth. Several days later, a rash develops, starting on the face and upper neck and gradually spreads downwards. A patient is infectious four days before the start of the rash to four days after the appearance of the rash. Most people recover within 2&ndash;3 weeks.Even with implementation of routine immunization, measles continues to circulate globally due to suboptimal vaccination coverage and population immunity gaps. Any community with less than 95% population immunity is at risk for an outbreak. If an outbreak response is not timely and comprehensive, the virus will find its way into more pockets of vulnerable individuals and potentially spread within and beyond the affected countries.The impact on public health will persist until the ongoing outbreaks are controlled, routine immunization coverage is continuously high (&ge; 95%) and immunity gaps in the population are closed. As long as measles continues to circulate anywhere in the world, no country can be assured to avoid importation. However, countries can protect their populations through high vaccine coverage achieved primarily through routine immunization programmes, and where necessary through supplemental immunization activities designed to assure that susceptible individuals are vaccinated.&nbsp;",

However, there is some evidence in the peer-reviewed literatures that DENV can be present in the semen of infected men or in vaginal secretions of infected women&nbsp;2.Subsequent vector borne dengue in Madrid, Spain is unlikely, since the vector is not established in the area where the cases reside. According to the data provided by the Spanish authorities, entomological surveillance which has been carried out in the Autonomous Community of Madrid since 2017, has detected the presence of&nbsp;Aedes&nbsp;mosquitoes in only one municipality (Velilla de San Antonio) which is far from any area visited by the cases. The upcoming winter season will also limit the vector activities.Dengue cases have been reported to the Spanish Surveillance Network over the past years: 198 in 2018; 132 in 2017, 262 in 2016, and 191 in 2015. Nearly all reported cases are imported with autochthonous cases reported for the first time in 2018 (six cases) and again in 2019(one case prior to the case included in this report). All seven autochthonous cases were acquired through vector-borne transmission and were reported from areas where&nbsp;Ae. albopictus&nbsp;is established (Autonomous Comunities of Murcia and Catalu&ntilde;a) and they had no recent travel history to dengue-endemic areas.In 2004 the first&nbsp;Ae. albopictus&nbsp;mosquitoes were detected in Spain, in Catalonia. Since then the mosquitoes have been found along the coast southward, with recent detections in few municipalities in western Spain. There is evidence of low activity of&nbsp;Ae. albopictus&nbsp;during winter in Murcia.

Human-to-human infections and laboratory transmission can also occur through direct contact with the blood, urine, faeces, or other bodily secretions of a person with Lassa fever. The overall case fatality rate is 1%; it is 15% among patients hospitalized with severe illness.Sierra Leone is endemic for Lassa fever and sporadic cases have been exported to Europe from endemic countries in Africa, such as Togo, Liberia and Nigeria in recent years. However, in general, the secondary transmission of Lassa fever through human contacts is rare.Data from recent imported cases show that secondary transmission of Lassa fever is rare when standard infection control precautions are observed. Further, epidemiological investigations are ongoing: Human-to-human transmission occurs in both community and health-care settings, where the virus may spread by contaminated medical equipment. Health care workers are at risk if caring for Lassa fever patients in the absence of appropriate infection prevention and control measures. Considering the seasonal flare-ups of cases in humid zones between December and March, countries in West Africa that are endemic for Lassa fever are encouraged to strengthen their related surveillance systems.",

Based on the Afghanistan Health Survey 2018, 57% population has access to primary health care (PHC) facility within half-hour distance, and 90% of the population has access to PHC facilities with a cumulative 2 hours distance. In addition, the country has limited capacity to prevent and control dengue outbreaks.The current cases of autochthonous dengue fever virus in the six affected provinces pose a risk to other areas in Afghanistan where the virus has not previously been recorded. Intense population movements during the rainy season pose an increased risk of spreading or intensifying the current dengue fever outbreaks.The lack of effective control programs in Afghanistan presents a challenge to the country&rsquo;s efforts to restrain the outbreak. Current winter conditions in Khost and Nangarhar provinces are expected to limit the proliferation of mosquitoes, thus reducing the risk of transmission.

2019-DON217,2019-DON217,2019-DON217,Assessment,"Measles is a highly contagious viral disease and remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among young children globally, despite the availability of a safe and effective vaccine. Globally, there has been an increasing trend of measles across all regions, with the resurgence of endemic measles and outbreaks in countries that had previously achieved elimination status. This reflects the risk that measles virus can spread when there is variability in immunization coverage at the district and local levels, or gaps in population immunity among specific sub-populations and marginalized groups. Infants too young to be vaccinated are at highest risk of measles; however, infants and those with medical contraindications to measles vaccination can be protected through herd (population) immunity when immunization coverage rates are high (&gt; 95%). Infants, populations with poor access to health care services and co-morbidities such as malnutrition, including Vitamin A deficiency are more vulnerable to infection and at higher risk for severe disease.Population movement is a large factor in the spread of measles and this has been demonstrated through the reporting of imported cases in multiple countries in the region. Countries experiencing regular movement of tourists or overseas workers, in particular those travelling to and from measles-affected countries, are at risk for introduction of measles, and countries with district and local level immunization coverage below 95% are vulnerable to outbreaks.Each year, measles continues to be reported from the Western Pacific Region. The most recent outbreaks in the Western Pacific Region have been fuelled by low immunization coverage due to gaps in routine immunization programs.Given that many PICs are popular tourist destinations and with the upcoming holidays, the number of travellers is expected to increase. In addition, the risk of spread to neighbouring islands and other countries cannot be ruled out. Moreover, the PIC context is unique due to (1) the islands setting and relative geographic isolation, (2) large number of population movement between PICs and to other countries in the Region, (3) high interaction amongst people, (4) absence of noticeable measles virus circulation for many years in most PICs and therefore limited experience with case management, and (5) accumulation of susceptible populations in a number of PICs (vaccinated but non- immunized cohorts, suboptimal vaccination coverage in several PICs, and population immunity below herd immunity thresholds in others.",

2022-DON396,2022-DON396,2022-DON396,Assessment,"The overall risk is assessed as moderate at global level considering this is the first time that cases and clusters are reported concurrently in five WHO Regions. At the regional level, the risk is considered to be high in the European Region due to its report of a geographically widespread outbreak involving several newly-affected countries, as well as a somewhat atypical clinical presentation of cases. In other WHO Regions, the risk is considered moderate with consideration for epidemiological patterns, possible risk of importation of cases and capacities to detect cases and respond to the outbreak.&nbsp; In newly-affected countries, this is the first time that cases have mainly, but not exclusively, been confirmed among men who have had recent sexual contact with a new or multiple male* partners. &nbsp;The unexpected appearance of monkeypox and the wide geographic spread of cases indicate that the monkeypox virus might have been circulating below levels detectable by the surveillance systems and sustained human-to-human transmission might have been undetected for a period of time. Routes of monkeypox virus transmission include human-to-human via direct contact with infectious skin or mucocutaneous lesions, respiratory droplets (and possibly short-range aerosols) or indirect contact from contaminated objects or materials, also described as fomite transmission. Vertical transmission (mother-to-child) has also been documented.&nbsp; While it is known that close physical contact can lead to transmission, it is unclear whether sexual transmission via semen/vaginal fluids occurs, research is currently underway to understand this. In addition, the likelihood of sustained community transmission cannot be ruled out and the extent to which pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic infection may occur as the infectious period is unknown, as well as the further spread of monkeypox virus among persons with multiple sexual partners in interconnected networks and the likely role of mass gatherings.&nbsp;&nbsp;The clinical presentation of monkeypox cases associated with this outbreak has been atypical as compared to previously documented reports: many cases in newly-affected areas are not presenting with the classically described clinical picture for monkeypox (fever, swollen lymph nodes, followed by centrifugal rash). Atypical features described include: presentation of only a few or even just a single lesionabsence of skin lesions in some cases, with anal pain and bleedinglesions in the genital or perineal/perianal area which do not spread furtherlesions appearing at different (asynchronous) stages of developmentthe appearance of lesions before the onset of fever, malaise and other constitutional symptoms (absence of prodromal period).The actual number of cases is likely to be underestimated, in part due to the lack of early clinical recognition of an infection previously known in only a handful of countries, and limited enhanced surveillance mechanisms in many countries for a disease previously &lsquo;unknown&rsquo; to most health systems. Health care-associated infections cannot be ruled out (although unproven to date in the current outbreak). There is a potential for increased health impact with wider dissemination in vulnerable groups as the mortality was previously reported as higher among children and young adults, and immunocompromised individuals, including people living with uncontrolled HIV infection, are especially at risk of severe disease.&nbsp;The risk is also represented by the difficulties involved in widespread lack of availability of laboratory diagnostics, antivirals and vaccines and as well as in ensuring adequate biosafety and biosecurity in diagnostic, clinical and referral laboratories everywhere that cases have occurred.&nbsp;A large part of the population is vulnerable to monkeypox virus, as smallpox vaccination, which is expected to provide some protection against monkeypox has been discontinued since the 1980s. Only a relatively small number of military, frontline health professionals and laboratory workers have been vaccinated against smallpox in recent years. A third-generation vaccine MVA received authorization of use by the European Medicines Agency for smallpox. The authorization of use provided by Health Canada and the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) includes an indication for the prevention of monkeypox. An antiviral agent, tecovirimat, has been approved by the European Medicines Agency, Health Canada, and the United States FDA for the treatment of smallpox.

The risk is further increased due to the decreased immunization rate related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;The risk of spread associated with the concurrent cVDPV2 outbreak is currently assessed as moderate due to historical and epidemiological evidence suggesting that WPVs have a significantly higher propensity for geographic spread than cVDPVs. However, a comprehensive outbreak response to both strains is urgently being implemented, as both strains have the capacity to cause paralytic disease in children.",
2022-DON393,2022-DON393,2022-DON393,Assessment,"Currently, the public health risk at the global level is assessed as moderate considering this is the first time that monkeypox cases and clusters are reported concurrently in many countries in widely disparate WHO geographical areas, balanced against the fact that mortality has remained low in the current outbreak. In apparently newly affected countries, cases have mainly, but not exclusively, been confirmed amongst men who self-identify as men who have sex with men, participating in extended sexual networks. Person to person transmission is ongoing, still primarily occurring in one demographic and social group.  It is likely that the actual number of cases remains an underestimate. This may in part be due to the lack of early clinical recognition of an infectious disease previously thought to occur mostly in West and Central Africa, a non-severe clinical presentation for most cases, limited surveillance, and a lack of widely available diagnostics. While efforts are underway to address these gaps, it is important to remain vigilant for monkeypox in all population groups to prevent onward transmission.At present, transmission in apparently newly affected countries is primarily linked to recent sexual contacts. There is the high likelihood that further cases will be found without identified chains of transmission, including potentially in other population groups. Given the number of countries across several WHO regions reporting cases of monkeypox, it is highly likely that other countries will identify cases and there will be further spread of the virus. Human-to-human transmission occurs through close or direct physical contact (face-to-face, skin-to-skin, mouth-to-mouth, mouth-to-skin) with infectious lesions or mucocutaneous ulcers including during sexual activity, respiratory droplets (and possibly short-range aerosols), or contact with contaminated materials (e.g., linens, bedding, electronics, clothing, sex toys). The current risk for the general public remains low. There is a risk to health workers if they are in contact with a case while not wearing appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) to prevent transmission; though not yet reported in this current outbreak, the risk of health care-associated infections has been documented in the past. Should monkeypox begin to spread more widely to and within more vulnerable groups, there is the potential for greater health &shy;&shy;&shy;impact as the risk of severe disease and mortality is recognized to be higher in immunocompromised individuals, including persons with poorly controlled HIV infection. While infection with monkeypox during pregnancy is not fully understood, limited data suggest that infection may lead to adverse outcomes for the foetus or newborn infant and for the mother.To date, all cases identified in newly affected countries whose samples were confirmed by PCR have been identified as being infected with the West African clade. There are two known clades of monkeypox virus, one first identified in West Africa (WA) and one in the Congo Basin (CB) region. The WA clade has in the past been associated with an overall lower case fatality ratio (CFR) of &lt;1% while the CB clade appears to more frequently cause severe disease with a CFR previously reported of up to about 10%; both estimates are based on infections among a generally younger population in the African setting. In the period following the eradication of smallpox, more people were immune to orthopoxviruses through exposure to smallpox or receipt of smallpox vaccine. Therefore, initially most early cases of human monkeypox were among children who were vulnerable and therefore at risk of more severe disease.Vaccination against smallpox was shown in the past to be cross-protective against monkeypox. Today, any continuing immunity from prior smallpox vaccination would in most cases only be present in persons over the age of 42 to 50 years or older, depending on the country, since smallpox vaccination programmes ended worldwide in 1980 after the eradication of smallpox. Protection for those who were vaccinated may have waned over time. The original (first generation) smallpox vaccines from the eradication programme are no longer available to the general public. Smallpox and monkeypox vaccines, where available, are being deployed in a few countries to manage close contacts. Second- and third-generation smallpox vaccines have been developed to have an improved safety profile and one has been approved for prevention of monkeypox. This vaccine is based on a strain of vaccinia virus (known generically as modified vaccinia Ankara Bavarian Nordic strain, or MVA-BN). This vaccine has been approved for prevention of monkeypox in Canada and the United States of America. In the European Union, this vaccine has been approved for prevention of smallpox under exceptional circumstances. An antiviral agent, tecovirimat, has been approved by the European Medicines Agency, Health Canada, and the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of smallpox. It is also approved in the European Union for treatment of monkeypox. WHO has convened experts to review the latest data on smallpox and monkeypox vaccines, and to provide guidance on how and in what circumstances they can be used.",
2022-DON391,2022-DON391,2022-DON391,Assessment,"The risk of potential international spread from Sindh province exists given that the most affected districts are located in Karachi city which is an industrial center as well as transport hub with airport and seaport; it is also the largest city in Pakistan and capital of Sindh province. Currently, no international cross-border spread has been confirmed for this event. However, with ongoing transmission in close proximity to border areas and transportation hubs, the risk of international spread cannot be ruled out. In Balochistan province, there is suboptimal surveillance, limited access to safe drinking water, and limited access to health care, and affected areas are in proximity to areas with active cross-border movement with Afghanistan and Iran. In Punjab, although response activities are taking place, the province is still recording an increased number of suspected cholera cases, including in Lahore, the provincial capital and large international commercial hub. Further spread to other provinces would worsen the situation given the frequent population movement.Necessary control measures are being implemented by the national authorities with support from WHO and partners to contain the outbreak, as described in the Public Health Response section above. However, there is a need to further strengthen surveillance by establishing systematic detection and laboratory confirmation of cholera to properly track the evolution of the outbreak and institute timely and appropriate interventions.",
2022-DON392,2022-DON392,2022-DON392,Assessment,"Currently, the public health risk at the global level is assessed as moderate considering this is the first time that monkeypox cases and clusters are reported concurrently in many countries in widely disparate WHO geographical areas and without known epidemiological links to countries where monkeypox has been reported for many years. Cases have mainly, but not exclusively, been identified amongst men self-identified as part of extended sexual networks. The sudden appearance and wide geographic scale indicate that widespread human-to-human transmission is underway, for the time being still primarily in one demographic and social group, and the virus may have been present and undetected for several weeks or longer. Additionally, there is currently limited epidemiological and laboratory information, and the actual number of cases is likely an underestimate. This may in part be due to the lack of early clinical recognition of an infection previously known to occur mostly in West and Central Africa, limited surveillance and a lack of rapid diagnostics.&nbsp;At present transmission in newly affected countries is primarily linked to recent sexual contacts. There is a high likelihood that further cases will be found without identified chains of transmission, including potentially in other population groups. Given the number of countries across several WHO regions reporting cases of monkeypox, it is highly likely that other countries will identify cases and there will be further spread of the virus. Human-to-human transmission occurs through close or direct physical contact with infectious lesions or mucocutaneous sores (through face-to-face, skin-to-skin, mouth-to-mouth, mouth-to-skin transmission) including during sexual activity, respiratory droplets (and possibly short-range aerosols), or contact with contaminated materials (e.g., linens, bedding and clothing).&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the current risk to human health and to the general public remains low, the public health risk would be greater if this virus exploits the opportunity to establish itself as a widespread human pathogen. There is also a risk to health workers if they are not wearing appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) to prevent contracting an infection; though not reported in this current outbreak, the risk of health care-associated infections has been documented in the past. There is the potential for increased health impact with wider dissemination in vulnerable groups, as the risk of severe disease and mortality is recognized to be higher among children and immunocompromised individuals, including persons with poorly controlled HIV. Infection with monkeypox in pregnancy is poorly understood, although limited data suggests that infection may lead to adverse outcomes for the foetus or newborn infant.&nbsp;To date, all cases identified in newly affected countries whose samples were confirmed by PCR have been identified as being infected with the West African clade. There are two known clades of monkeypox, one identified in West Africa (WA) and one in the Congo Basin (CB) region.

The sudden appearance and wide geographic scope of many cases that initially appeared to be sporadic cases indicate that extended human-to-human transmission was facilitated by frequent encounters between persons in close proximity and/or with physical contact. Some countries are reporting that new generations of cases are no longer appearing only among known contacts of previously confirmed cases, suggesting that chains of transmission are being missed through undetected circulation of the virus. &nbsp;Additionally, as epidemiological and laboratory information are still limited, the actual number of cases is likely an underestimate.

There is also a risk to health workers if they are not using adequate infection prevention and control (IPC) measures or wearing appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) when necessary, to prevent transmission. Though not reported in this current outbreak, the risk of health care associated infections has been documented in the past in both endemic and non-endemic areas. There is the potential for increased health impact with wider dissemination in vulnerable groups, as the risk of severe disease and mortality is recognized to be higher among children and immunocompromised individuals. There is limited data among people living with HIV, but those who take antiretrovirals and have a robust immune system have not reported a more severe course; those people living with HIV who are not on treatment or remain immunosuppressed may have a more severe course, as documented in the literature. Infection with monkeypox in pregnancy is poorly understood, although limited data suggest that infection may lead to adverse outcomes for the foetus.To date, all cases identified in non-endemic countries whose samples were confirmed by PCR have been identified as being infected with the West African clade.

2022-DON386,2022-DON386,2022-DON386,Assessment,"Thiqar governorate is divided into rural (42% of the governorate) and urban (58%) areas, where livestock farming of sheep, goats, cattle, camels, and buffaloes is an important source of livelihood, especially for the rural population. Subsistent farming is common in villages where animal barns are located near houses and all family members take care of domestic animals. In these settings, CCHF may be transmitted from domestic animals to humans. There is an increased risk of further spread of CCHF within Iraq due to the upcoming religious holiday, Eid al-Adha in July, because more camels, cows, and sheep will be slaughtered during that period. Additionally, international cross-border transmission cannot be ruled out given the increased population movement and possible animal exportation associated with the holiday. During Ramadan, which took place in March and April 2022, the number of CCHF cases steadily increased, and the geographical spread of the disease expanded to more governorates.",
2022-DON388,2022-DON388,2022-DON388,Assessment,"Currently, the overall public health risk at global level is assessed as moderate considering this is the first time that monkeypox cases and clusters are reported concurrently in widely disparate WHO geographical areas, and without known epidemiological links to endemic countries in West or Central Africa. Cases have been mainly reported amongst MSM. Additionally, the sudden appearance and wide geographic scope of many sporadic cases indicates that widespread human-to-human transmission is already underway, and the virus may have been circulating unrecognized for several weeks or longer. The public health risk could become high if this virus exploits the opportunity to establish itself as a human pathogen and spreads to groups at higher risk of severe disease such as young children and immunosuppressed persons; a large part of the population is vulnerable to monkeypox virus, as smallpox vaccination, which confers some cross-protection, has been discontinued since 1980 or earlier in some countries. There is currently limited epidemiological and laboratory information, and the number of cases currently being reported is likely to be an underestimate, in part due the following: the relatively mild symptoms in many cases with localized rash and lymphadenopathy, such that many persons may not present to health care services&nbsp; lack of early clinical recognition by health workers of an infection previously known in only a few countries; the time required by Member States to establish and scale up new surveillance mechanisms. and a lack of widely available diagnostic tests, reagents and other supplies. There is a potential risk to health workers if they are not wearing appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) to prevent transmission. Though not reported in the current outbreak, the risk of health care associated monkeypox infections has been documented in the past. There is the potential for greater health impact with wider spread to vulnerable population groups, as deaths among cases in previous outbreaks have been reported to occur more often among children, and immunocompromised individuals, including persons with poorly controlled HIV infection, who may be especially at risk of more severe disease.Furthermore, there is the high likelihood of identification of further cases with unidentified chains of transmission, including potentially in other population groups. With a number of countries in several WHO regions reporting cases of monkeypox, it is highly likely that even more countries will identify cases. As monkeypox lesions commonly occur on the skin over many or all parts of the body, as well as in the mouth, there is a high risk of further spread of the virus through close physical contact within families or with sexual partners, including face-to-face, skin-to-skin, or mouth-to-skin contact, or contact with contaminated materials (e.g., linen, bedding, clothing or utensils). However, at present, the risk for the general public appears to be low. Nonetheless, immediate action from countries is required to control further spread among groups at risk, prevent spread to the general population and avert the establishment of monkeypox as a clinical condition and public health problem in currently non-endemic countries.&nbsp;",
2022-DON389,DON-389,2022-DON389,Assessment,"WHO assesses the risk at the global level as moderate considering that:The aetiology of this severe acute hepatitis remains unknown and under investigation; the cases are more clinically severe and a higher proportion develops acute liver failure compared with previous reports of acute hepatitis of unknown aetiology in children;Limited epidemiological, laboratory, histopathological and clinical information is currently available to WHO;The actual number of cases may be underestimated in some settings, in part due to the limited surveillance capacity in place;The source and mode of transmission of the potential aetiologic agent(s) has not yet been determined, and so the likelihood of further spread cannot &nbsp;be fully assessed;Although there are no available reports of healthcare-associated infections, human-to-human transmission cannot be ruled out as there have been a few reports of epidemiologically linked cases.Adenovirus has been found in 75% of the cases tested in the United Kingdom, but the data for other countries are incomplete. Of the small number of samples that have so far been typed, a majority have been confirmed for Type 41 adenovirus (in the United Kingdom, in 27 of 35 cases with an available result). Adenovirus associated virus 2 (AAV-2) has also been detected in a small number of cases in the United Kingdom using meta-genomics in liver and blood samples. However, many of the remaining cases did not have appropriate samples taken, highlighting the importance of appropriate sampling (whole blood) to further characterize the type of adenovirus detected. Additionally, Type 41 adenovirus infection has not previously been linked to such a clinical presentation in otherwise healthy children.While adenovirus is a plausible hypothesis as part of the pathogenesis mechanism, further investigations are ongoing for the causative agent; adenovirus infection (which generally causes mild self-limiting gastrointestinal or respiratory infections in young children) does not fully explain the more severe clinical picture observed with these cases. Factors such as increased susceptibility amongst young children following a lower level of circulation of adenovirus during the COVID-19 pandemic, the potential emergence of a novel adenovirus, SARS-CoV-2 co-infection or a complication of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, leading to superantigen-mediated immune cell activation, proposed a causal mechanism of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children need to be further investigated. Hypotheses related to side effects from COVID-19 vaccines are currently not supported as most of the affected children did not receive these vaccines. Other infectious and non-infectious explanations as independent or contributory factors need to be excluded to fully assess and manage the risk. It is important to note that the current apparent association identified with adenovirus could be an incidental finding due to enhanced laboratory testing in association with increased levels of community transmission of adenovirus. This will be further clarified with the expansion of adenovirus testing to other cases beyond Europe and the United States, and reporting of the findings from the UKHSA case-control study currently underway.The absence of a confirmed aetiology poses additional challenges in some countries, including implementation of WHO&rsquo;s case definition and further diagnostic exclusion, due to limited testing capacity, including for Hepatitis A-E viruses and adenovirus. The presence of cases of acute hepatitis in children cannot be ruled out in countries where cases have not been detected or reported yet, but it is unlikely that symptomatic and severely ill case patients requiring hospitalization would remain undetected.",
2022-DON387,2022-DON387,2022-DON387,Assessment,"The risk at national level is currently assessed as high due to the (i) presence of the mosquito vector Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus; (ii) favourable environment for mosquito breeding grounds following heavy rains and floods since December 2021; (iii) concurrent outbreaks of diarrheal disease, malaria, COVID-19 among other health challenges; and (iv) decreased functionality of sanitation and water management systems in health facilities due to structural damage after heavy flooding. The reported numbers are likely an underestimate because a high proportion of dengue cases are asymptomatic, and there are limitations to the capacity to conduct surveillance and diagnose cases. Clinical management of severe dengue cases is also a challenge. Community awareness in the country is low, and risk communication activities are insufficient.&nbsp;The overall risk at the regional and global levels are assessed as low. The likelihood of further spread from S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; and Pr&iacute;ncipe to other countries is unlikely because the country is an island that does not share land borders and it would require the presence of susceptible vectors.&nbsp;",
2022-DON385,2022-DON385,2022-DON385,Assessment,"Endemic monkeypox disease is normally geographically limited to West and Central Africa. The identification of confirmed and suspected cases of monkeypox without any travel history to an endemic area in multiple countries is atypical, hence, there is an urgent need to raise awareness about monkeypox and undertake comprehensive case finding and isolation (provided with supportive care), contact tracing and supportive care to limit further onward transmission. Cross-protective immunity from smallpox vaccination will be limited to older persons, since populations worldwide under the age of 40 or 50 years no longer benefit from the protection afforded by prior smallpox vaccination programmes. There is little immunity to monkeypox among younger people living in non-endemic countries since the virus has not been present there.Historically, vaccination against smallpox had been shown to be protective against monkeypox. While one vaccine (MVA-BN) and one specific treatment (tecovirimat) were approved for monkeypox, in 2019 and 2022 respectively, these countermeasures are not yet widely available.Based on currently available information, cases have mainly but not exclusively been identified amongst men who have sex with men (MSM) seeking care in primary care and sexual health clinics.&nbsp; No deaths have been reported to date. However, the extent of local transmission is unclear at this stage, as surveillance has been limited. There is a high likelihood of identification of further cases with unidentified chains of transmission, including in other population groups. With a number of countries in several WHO regions reporting cases of monkeypox, it is highly likely that other countries will identify cases. The situation is evolving and WHO expects there will be more cases of monkeypox identified as surveillance expands in non-endemic countries. So far, there have been no deaths associated with this outbreak. Immediate actions focus on informing those most at risk for monkeypox infection with accurate information, stopping further spread and protecting frontline workers.",
2022-DON384,2022-DON384,2022-DON384,Assessment,"Based on currently available information, this is a sporadic case and there is no evidence of disease spread so far. WHO assesses the risk to the general population posed by this virus to be low and the risk to occupationally exposed persons to be low-to-moderate. As the investigations are still being conducted by the national authority, the risk level will be amended accordingly if warranted.&nbsp;Pigs are susceptible to avian, human and swine influenza viruses; they potentially may be infected with influenza viruses from different species at the same time. If this happens, it is possible for the genes of these viruses to mix and create a new virus. This type of major change in the influenza A viruses is known as antigenic shift. If this new virus causes illness in people and can be transmitted easily from person-to-person with no population immunity, an influenza pandemic may occur.&nbsp;Should individuals infected with a variant influenza virus travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during travel or after arrival. If this were to occur, further community level spread is considered unlikely as this virus has not acquired the ability to transmit easily among humans.&nbsp;",

There is a seasonal pattern of cholera occurrence in Cameroon that varies by region.&nbsp; In South-West and Littoral, currently the most affected regions, cholera is most often reported during the rainy season (November - April) or the transition between the rainy and the dry season. In the Central region, cholera is more frequently reported during the rainy season that occurs in May-June and October-November. The ongoing rainy season may increase the likelihood of further transmission in the country.In addition, some affected areas of the country are insecure which further reduces the access to services making outbreak response more complex.The cholera outbreak began surging in late October 2021, deteriorated further in March 2022 with the South-West region reporting 70% of cases. Limited geographic accessibility of some areas, security constraints, and suboptimal communication networks lead to irregular epidemiological updates and potential underreporting of cases. Additionally, high population movement of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs), weak health system, insufficient human resources, poor knowledge of treatment protocols and low risk communication for cholera continue to pose challenges.Furthermore, in the northern areas, Cameroon is bordered by Adamawa, Borno and Taraba states of Nigeria and there is frequent and substantial cross border movement posing a risk of transmission. There is also a risk of further international spread especially to the Republic of Chad which borders both Nigeria and Cameroon.The country is conducting cholera vaccination which should help contain the outbreak, however, additional efforts supplemented by other interventions including access to adequate treatment and clean water are needed in order to control the outbreak.",
2022-DON381,2022-DON381,2022-DON381,Assessment,"In the United Kingdom, there have been seven cases of monkeypox previously reported; all importations were related to a travel history to or from Nigeria. In 2021, there were also two separate human monkeypox cases imported from Nigeria reported by the United States of America.Since September 2017, Nigeria has continued to report cases of monkeypox. From September 2017 to 30 April 2022, a total of 558 suspected cases have been reported from 32 states in the country. Of these, 241 were confirmed cases, and among these there were eight deaths recorded (Case Fatality Ratio: 3.3%). From 1 January to 30 April 2022, 46 suspected cases have been reported of which 15 were confirmed from seven states - Adamawa (three cases), Lagos (three cases), Cross River (two cases), Federal Capital Territory (FCT) (two cases), Kano (two cases), Delta (two cases) and Imo (one case). No death has been recorded in 2022.In the present case, the source of infection is currently unknown and the risk of further transmission in Nigeria cannot be excluded. Once monkeypox was suspected in the United Kingdom, authorities promptly initiated appropriate public health measures, including isolation of the case and contact tracing. The risk of potential onward spread related to this case in the United Kingdom is therefore minimal. As the source of infection in Nigeria is not known, there remains a risk of further transmission in Nigeria.Importations of monkeypox from an endemic country to another country has been documented on eight previous occasions.

2022-DON382,2022-DON382,2022-DON382,Assessment,"The risk for this outbreak at the national level is considered high, because Lassa virus is endemic in the country associated with the presence of the animal host reservoir, Mastomys rats. In addition, there are limited financial, human and logistical resources and the Guinean health system has been severely overwhelmed since last year. In 2021, Guinea experienced several concurrent emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases such as Ebola, Marburg, Lassa fever, measles, meningitis, yellow fever, vaccine-derived polio type 1, and COVID-19. This outbreak could have a serious impact on public health due to the already fragile health system. The results of preliminary epidemiological investigations suggest that there is a risk of nosocomial and community transmission from the first case. At the regional and global level, the risk of spread is considered low due to the primary mode of transmission of the disease, being the exposure to rodents. Although Gu&eacute;ck&eacute;dou is located in proximity to the international borders with Liberia and Sierra Leone, the risk of cross-border transmission of cases can be considered low. However, since Lassa fever is endemic in Liberia and Sierra Leone due to the presence of Mastomys rodents, the risk of exposure is present in these two countries.&nbsp;",
2022-DON370,2022-DON370,2022-DON370,Assessment,"MERS-CoV is a viral respiratory infection of humans and dromedary camels which is caused by a coronavirus called Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus. Infection with MERS-CoV can cause severe disease resulting in high mortality. Approximately 35% of reported patients with MERS-CoV have died, but this may be an overestimate of the true mortality rate, as mild cases of MERS-CoV may be missed by existing surveillance systems and the case fatality rates are counted only amongst the laboratory-confirmed cases.Humans are infected with MERS-CoV from direct or indirect contact with dromedaries who are the natural host and zoonotic source of MERS-CoV infection. MERS-CoV has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans but it has, so far, mainly occurred in health care settings and to a limited extent among close contacts. One of the new reported cases had travel history outside of Qatar and it is likely that the infection was acquired as a result of zoonotic infection from direct or indirect contact with infected dromedary camels. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be exported from countries where MERS-CoV is circulating in dromedaries by travelers who may acquire infection after exposure to: 1) infected dromedaries or dromedary products (for example, following contact with camels); or 2) to infected humans (for example, in a health care setting). As of 12 May 2022, the total number of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection cases reported globally to WHO is 2591 including 894 associated deaths and reflects the total number of laboratory-confirmed cases and deaths reported to WHO under IHR (2005) to date.

The most recent case in humans prior to the current case, was reported in January 2022 in a case who had symptom onset in December 2021, from the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.&nbsp;Whenever avian influenza viruses are circulating in poultry, there is a risk for sporadic infection and small clusters of human cases due to exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments.

Additionally, due to inadequate IPC measures in place at the health facilities there is also the risk of spread among health workers and co-patients of the two facilities which the patient visited prior to the confirmation of EVD.The exposure of the first case remains unknown, and therefore, it is difficult to assess the extent of the outbreak at this stage.The current resurgence is not unexpected given that EVD is endemic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Ebola virus is present in animal reservoirs in the region. A confluence of environmental and socioeconomic factors such as poverty, community mistrust, weak health systems, and political instability may be accelerating the rate of the emergence of EVD in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.Although Mbandaka has experienced two EVD outbreaks in 2020 and 2018, some of the improvements achieved by establishing capacities such as IPC measures in health facilities during previous outbreaks have not been maintained over time to tackle the current outbreak. There is a need to support the province's health professionals to conduct an effective response. In addition, logistical support is needed to reactivate the health infrastructure that was put in place during previous epidemics.The risk of regional and international spread of this epidemic is not precluded as the city of Mbandaka borders the Congo River and has river and land connections with the capital Kinshasa, the Republic of Congo, the Central African Republic, and Angola. Mbandaka also has air connections with Sud Ubangi province bordering Central African Republic and the Republic of Congo and the capital Democratic Republic of the Congo - Kinshasa.&nbsp;The risk associated with EVD in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is high due to the presence of animal reservoirs or intermediate hosts implicated in previous spill-over events, the high frequency of these outbreaks, environmental and anthropogenic factors1 , and reduced capacity of the public health sector due to other ongoing outbreaks of cholera, measles, monkeypox, and COVID-19 pandemic in the context of&nbsp; a protracted humanitarian crisis due to ongoing violence and conflict.The risk at regional and global level is assessed to be moderate and low respectively. WHO is closely monitoring the situation and the risk assessment will be updated as more information becomes available.",
2022-DON365,2022-DON365,2022-DON365,Assessment,"Human, animal and environmental investigations are ongoing to understand the increased transmission of JEV in humans and animals in Australia in 2022 and better assess the current and future risk. Serological evidence of JEV exposure is periodically detected in animals in the Torres Strait Islands off the north coast of Queensland, but transmission on the mainland has not been previously established. The current event therefore represents a significant change in the presence of the virus in Australia. Local transmission of JEV to humans requires environmental conditions capable of sustaining an enzootic cycle, thus, the risk of infection can vary substantially within any endemic country. JE transmission intensifies during the rainy season, during which vector populations increase. Internationally, there has not yet been evidence of increased JEV transmission following major floods or tsunamis.Thirty-seven confirmed and probable cases of infection with JEV including three deaths have been identified in Australia with symptom onsets from 31 December 2021. The latest symptom onset of the cases was 14 March 2022. The cases were reported from four different states, three of which had no history of past local JE virus transmission. Vaccination against JEV is not used for the general population in Australia and is usually only advised for people travelling to endemic regions and for people undertaking activities with increased risk of exposure, thus, the immunologically naive population could be more susceptible to severe disease. As the colder months approach in southern Australia, a reduction in mosquito populations, and with that, a reduction in transmission is expected in all susceptible species.The risk at the regional and global level is assessed as low. The JEV does not transmit between humans, therefore the likelihood of international disease spread among humans is low. However occasional overseas acquired cases have been reported among unvaccinated individuals returning from an area with active transmission.",

2022-DON372,2022-DON372,2022-DON372,Assessment,"Cholera is endemic in Malawi with seasonal outbreaks being reported from 1998 to 2020. The Southern region, which shares border with Mozambique, remains the hotspot of the recurrent cholera outbreaks. The detection of cholera cases is concerning as Malawi has low population immunity in the districts reporting confirmed cases.The main factors attributed to the initiation and ongoing spread of the cholera epidemics in the two affected districts include:&bull;	Tropical storm and floods&bull;	Inadequate hygiene and sanitation&nbsp; &nbsp;&bull;	Limited access to safe drinking water and personal hygiene practices&bull;	Open defecation&bull;	Delay in seeking careOther identified challenges from Nsanje and neighbouring at-risk districts (Balaka and Chikwawa) include poor capacity for sample collection, transportation, and diagnosis in the affected areas mainly due to the difficult access following floods.&nbsp;Additionally, Malawi shares international borders with Mozambique, and there is frequent and substantial cross-border population movement, including people displaced following the floods caused by the tropical cyclone. This poses a risk of cross-border transmission of cholera.Close monitoring of the situation with active cross-border coordination and information sharing remains crucial.",
2022-DON369,2022-DON369,2022-DON369,Assessment,"Salmonella infections are typically mild and do not require treatment, however, children and elderly individuals are at greater risk for severe complications related to associated dehydration. To date, most cases have been in children under 10 years of age which may be due to the implicated product being targeted at children. While there have been no fatalities associated with the outbreak reported as of 25 April 2022, among the cases with information on symptoms and severity (n=21), a high hospitalization rate (43%; n=9) was observed. Further information is needed to allow for a more accurate assessment of the severity associated with this event, including data on symptoms.The outbreak has been epidemiologically and molecularly linked to chocolate produced in Belgium and distributed globally to over 113 countries and territories across all WHO Regions. While 150 of 151 known cases have been reported in Europe, one case has been reported in the United States of America and there is the likelihood of additional cases being reported from other countries given the broad distribution of the products during the Easter holiday which may lead to increased consumption of the implicated product or transportation of the implicated product to additional locations as a result of holiday-related travel.Given that the identification of existing cases was through advanced molecular techniques, which are not routinely used in all countries, there is a likelihood that some proportion of cases will go undetected. The risk of the event spreading within the most affected WHO Region, the WHO European Region, as well as globally is assessed as moderate until information is available on the full recall of the implicated products. Countries that have reported cases have good capacity for case management; however, information on disease severity associated with this event is still limited.",
2022-DON367,2022-DON367,2022-DON367,Assessment,"Uganda is endemic for yellow fever and is classified as a high-risk country in the Eliminate Yellow Fever Epidemics (EYE) Strategy. The country has history of outbreaks reported in 2020 (Buliisa, Maracha and Moyo districts), 2019 (Masaka and Koboko districts), 2016 (Masaka, Rukungiri, and Kalangala districts) and in 2010 when ten districts were affected in Northern Uganda.The confirmed case is reported from Wakiso district, close to the greater Kampala metropolitan area. The district also includes Entebbe, where the international airport is located.Uganda has not introduced the yellow fever vaccine into routine immunization and the estimated overall population immunity is low (4.2%), and attributable to past reactive vaccination activities supported by ICG in focal districts including Yumbe, Moyo, Buliisa, Maracha, Koboko (2020), Masaka, and Koboko (2019), in limited scope in the Greater Kampala area (2017), Masaka, Rukungiri, and Kalangala districts (2016).Epidemic spread of yellow fever is a risk in Uganda as there could be onward amplification if the virus is introduced in crowded urban areas that are known hubs for travel. There is the risk for further amplification and international spread because of frequent population movements (e.g., between Uganda, Democratic Republic of Congo and South Sudan), coupled with the low population immunity in some neighbouring countries.The recurrent outbreaks indicate the ongoing risk of zoonotic spill over of yellow fever and risk for disease amplification in both rural and densely settled urban areas in the largely unimmunized population. Despite the yellow fever vaccine being highly effective (99% effective within 30 days of vaccination), the risk of breakthrough cases exists. &nbsp;These cases should be investigated to identify and address possible causes of vaccine failure.Considering the above-described scenario, the risk is assessed as high at the national and regional levels, and low at the global level.WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and review the risk assessment based on the latest available information.",
2022-DON376,2022-DON376,2022-DON376,Assessment,"The United Kingdom first reported an unexpected significant increase in cases of severe acute hepatitis of unknown origin in young, generally previously healthy children. An unexpected increase of such cases has now been reported by several other countries &ndash; notably Ireland and the Netherlands.While adenovirus is currently one hypothesis as the underlying cause, it does not fully explain the severity of the clinical picture. Infection with adenovirus type 41, the implicated adenovirus type, has not previously been linked to such a clinical presentation. Adenoviruses are common pathogens that usually cause self-limited infections. They spread from person-to-person and most commonly cause respiratory illness, but depending on the type, can also cause other illnesses such as gastroenteritis (inflammation of the stomach or intestines), conjunctivitis (pink eye), and cystitis (bladder infection). There are more than 50 types of immunologically distinct adenoviruses that can cause infections in humans. Adenovirus type 41 typically presents as diarrhea, vomiting, and fever, often accompanied by respiratory symptoms. While there have been case reports of hepatitis in immunocompromised children with adenovirus infection, adenovirus type 41 is not known to be a cause of hepatitis in otherwise healthy children.Factors such as increased susceptibility amongst young children following a lower level of circulation of adenovirus during the COVID-19 pandemic, the potential emergence of a novel adenovirus, as well as SARS-CoV-2 co-infection, need to be further investigated. Hypotheses related to side effects from the COVID-19 vaccines are currently not supported as the vast majority of affected children did not receive COVID-19 vaccination. Other infectious and non-infectious explanations need to be excluded to fully assess and manage the risk.With continued new notifications of recent onset cases, at least in the United Kingdom, together with more extensive case searching, it is very likely that more cases will be detected before the cause can be confirmed and more specific control and prevention measures can be implemented.WHO is closely monitoring the situation and working with the United Kingdom health authorities, other Member States and partners.",
2022-DON366,2022-DON366,2022-DON366,Assessment,"Given the high level of vaccination coverage and robust surveillance system in Israel, the risk of further spread in the country, and in the occupied Palestinian territory, is likely to be moderate, as immunization gaps persist in certain high-risk areas/population groups. WHO currently assesses the risk of further international spread associated with this cVDPV3 detection as low due to high population immunity, robust AFP surveillance, and existing response capacity. Investigation and response activities are being coordinated between the public health authorities of Israel and occupied Palestinian territory, and between WHO European and Eastern-Mediterranean Regional Offices.",
2022-DON368,2022-DON368,2022-DON368,Assessment,"The United Kingdom has reported a recent unexpected significant increase in cases of severe acute hepatitis of unknown aetiology in young children. Although the potential role of adenovirus and/or SARS-CoV-2 in the pathogenesis of these cases is one hypothesis, other infectious and non-infectious factors need to be fully investigated to properly assess and manage the risk.As there is an on-going increasing trend in cases in the United Kingdom over the past month together with more extensive case searching, it is very likely that more cases will be detected before the aetiology has been found (either biological, chemical or other agent(s)) and corresponding appropriate control and prevention measures have been taken. WHO is closely monitoring the situation with other Member States and the United Kingdom and partners for cases with similar profiles.",
2022-DON363,2022-DON363,2022-DON363,Assessment,"The notification of the six cases does not change the overall risk assessment. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East and/or other countries where MERS-CoV is circulating in dromedary camels, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who were exposed to the virus through contact with dromedary camels or their products (for example, consumption of camel&rsquo;s raw milk), or in a healthcare setting. WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information.The number of MERS-CoV cases reported to WHO has substantially declined since the beginning of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic (Figure 2). This is likely the result of epidemiological surveillance activities for COVID-19 being prioritized, resulting in reduced testing and detection of MERS-CoV cases. The Ministry of Health of Saudi Arabia continues to work to improve testing capacities for better detection of MERS-CoV during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.",
2022-DON361,2022-DON361,2022-DON361,Assessment,"Kenya is endemic for yellow fever and is classified as a high-risk country in the Eliminate Yellow Fever Epidemics (EYE) Strategy. Previous outbreaks have been reported in 1992, 1993, 1995 and 2011 in the western part of the country (Rift Valley zone). In 2016, two imported cases from Angola were also reported. Epidemic spread of yellow fever is a risk in Kenya as the estimated routine yellow fever vaccination coverage is very low among the target population (7%) and is limited in scope to four counties in the western part of the country (Baringo, Elgeyo Marakwet, West Pokot and Turkana).Yellow fever has never been reported in Isiolo county, which is a pastoralist and remote area, around 270 km north of the capital Nairobi. The total population of Isiolo county was estimated at 268 002 in 2019 according to the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics. Although Isiolo is in the central region of Kenya and does not share international borders, it is marked by frequent population movements. Garba Tulla ward shares borders with South Wajir and Western Garissa counties that have been experiencing massive pastoralists movements, amplified by current drought conditions. There is also massive refugee migration from neighbouring Somalia into Garissa county, Kenya. A national park is also located in the area near Isiolo, and the presence of informal mining activities attracting large numbers of workers as well as the presence of non-human primates has been noted, underlying the potential risk of spread to other areas.Considering the above-described scenario, the risk is assessed as high at the national and regional levels, and low at the global level. WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and review the risk assessment based on the latest available information.",
2022-DON364,2022-DON364,2022-DON364,Assessment,"Based on the limited information available at this stage, the likelihood of spread from the United Kingdom to other countries and the prevalence of XDR S. sonnei is high. Some findings from case interviews suggest possible exposure in other countries. Authorities in the United Kingdom are investigating cases in other countries that may be linked to the same cluster. &nbsp;&nbsp;The risk of spread of this particular strain of S. sonnei among the general population and the proportion of secondary cases among non-high-risk groups is unknown.The recent increase in S. sonnei infections in the United Kingdom may represent an increase in reporting activities following the COVID-19 pandemic and resumption of social contact, especially in MSM exposed to high-risk sexual practices and in immunocompromised adults. This outbreak may represent a serious public health impact because the pathogen is XDR and the number of cases is unusually above previously reported numbers in the United Kingdom in 2020-2021. In addition, the mechanism of antimicrobial resistance by which this S. sonnei strain has gained XDR characteristics is unusual and bacteria with this type of resistance mechanism have not been frequently reported in the United Kingdom recently. Currently, phenotypic data and Whole Genomic Sequencing (WGS) data from isolates is limited, which challenges the characterization and tracking of the event. Thus far, cases have only been reported in countries with high surveillance capacity and high water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) standards. However, the long carriage of Shigella bacteria post-infection, the potential role of asymptomatic carriers, and the very low infective dose are factors that could enable spread of the XDR strains globally. If XDR S. sonnei is introduced to resource limited countries where WASH conditions are suboptimal, there is a risk for a major diarrhoeal disease outbreak with potentially a high case fatality rate, including among children. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;",
2022-DON362,2022-DON362,2022-DON362,Assessment,"The country has proven to have adequate response capacity to Lassa fever outbreaks in the past, however, several challenges including lack of resources for case management such as insufficient number of isolation rooms, stock shortages of antiviral treatment and supportive therapy, lack of reinforcement of infection prevention and control measures in health facilities, as well as delays in sample testing turnaround times have been noted in the country during the current outbreak. Additionally, the borders are very porous in this area with constant cross-border movement which poses a risk for transmission to neighbouring countries. However, given the management of past outbreaks and the experience with cross-border communication between national health ministries regarding Lassa fever outbreaks, the risk of transmission remains low at the national and regional level.",
2022-DON360,wild-poliovirus-type-1-(WPV1)-malawi,2022-DON360,Assessment,"Polio is a highly infectious disease, caused by a virus that invades the nervous system and can cause permanent paralysis (approximately one in 200 infections) or death (approximately 2-10% of paralyzed cases). The virus is transmitted by person-to-person, mainly through the faecal-oral route or, less frequently, by a common vehicle (for example, contaminated water or food).Two of the three types of wild poliovirus have been eradicated (WPV2 and WPV3), with ongoing global efforts to eradicate WPV1. Currently, wild poliovirus is endemic in two countries: Pakistan and Afghanistan. The detection of WPV1 outside the two countries where the disease is endemic demonstrates the continuous risk of international spread of the disease until every corner of the world is free of WPV1.The risk at the national level in Malawi is assessed as high given the presence of high population density, low vaccination coverage (&lt;80%) in many districts and lack of a catch-up campaign for more than six years, accumulated susceptible populations, suboptimal AFP surveillance, and lack of environmental surveillance, that may be affecting the ability to ascertain cases. Furthermore, the switch from the trivalent Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV) to bivalent OPV in Malawi was completed on 25 April 2016, and Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV) was introduced on 14 December 2018. The most recent supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) with a vaccine containing type 2 vaccine were conducted in 2013.Additionally, the country is currently affected by tropical storm Ana which may impact the country&rsquo;s response capacity by impairing Polio SIAs and surveillance activities. According to the UN flash update on Malawi tropical storm Ana, as of 11 February, there have been 995 072 people affected in 19 districts, 206 people injured, 46 people reported dead, and 18 people are reported still missing. The United Nations and partners are supporting the life-saving emergency flood responseThe risk at the regional level is assessed as moderate given the significant population movement between Mozambique and Malawi, suboptimal vaccination coverage in the neighbouring countries, and suboptimal AFP surveillance activities.The risk at the global level is assessed as low given the existing response capacity in place and the moderately high global Polio coverage estimates.",
2022-DON358,lassa-fever---nigeria,2022-DON358,Assessment,"Lassa fever is a viral haemorrhagic fever that is primarily transmitted to humans via contact with food or household items contaminated with urine or faeces from Mastomys rats. Though to a lesser extent, secondary human-to-human transmission can also occur through direct contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other body fluids of infected persons, especially in health-care settings. As aforementioned, the peak of Lassa fever cases in humans typically occurs in the dry season (December-April) and follows the reproduction cycle of the Mastomys rats in the wet season (May &ndash; November). Given that 90-95% of human infections are due to indirect exposure (through food or household items contaminated by infected rats&rsquo; excreta) or direct contact with infected Mastomys rats, the very high density and high circulation of Lassa fever virus in the rat population poses a risk for further human infection during the dry season.Approximately 80% of Lassa virus infections in humans are either asymptomatic or mild, however, infection in the remaining 20% manifests as a febrile illness of variable severity associated with multiple organ dysfunctions with or without haemorrhage. The overall case fatality ratio among all infected people is approximately 1% but is significantly higher among patients hospitalized with severe illness (around 15%).Timely diagnosis results in more rapid isolation of patients and provision of treatment, while also reducing the risk of person-to-person transmission in health care settings. Early supportive care with rehydration and symptomatic treatment improves survival of patients. The current overall risk is considered high at national level. While Lassa fever is endemic in Nigeria and the country has developed an increased capacity for the prevention and control of Lassa fever outbreaks, including strengthened surveillance, diagnostic and treatment capacity, several factors contribute to the current elevated risk level. These include an increase in the number of confirmed cases compared to previous epidemic seasons, gaps in surveillance and varying degrees of subnational response capacity, delays in sample shipment for laboratory testing, a decrease of case management capacity due to conversion of dedicated Lassa fever facilities into COVID-19 health-care facilities and suboptimal IPC procedures. These factors combined warrant the need for further improvement and support of the country&rsquo;s capacity to detect and respond to Lassa fever outbreaks. In addition, the five confirmed cases among health workers, which included two workers caring for the same patient in the emergency ward, further emphasizes the urgent need to strengthen IPC measures. The overall regional and global risk is considered low due to minimal cross-border transmission from Nigeria to neighbouring countries. Lassa fever is known to be endemic in West African countries, primarily in Sierra Leone, Guinea, Liberia and Nigeria, but may exist in other countries in the same region.",
2022-DON357,measles-afghanistan,2022-DON357,Assessment,"Measles is a very highly contagious, vaccine-preventable disease caused by a virus that is transmitted by air and through direct contact with infected cases. Unvaccinated young children are at the highest risk of measles and its complications (e.g. pneumonia and encephalitis), including death. Measles outbreaks can result in epidemics with a high case fatality rate, especially among young, malnourished children.Afghanistan is considered a fragile, conflict-affected and vulnerable setting. The country has faced years of compounded crises, under-investment, instability and drought, and has now the highest number of people in emergency food insecurity in the world. According to UNICEF, 14 million people in Afghanistan are facing acute food insecurity, and an estimated 3.2 million children under five years suffer from acute malnutrition.The large and widespread outbreaks and the increasing number of reported measles cases in Afghanistan, is due to a variety of complex factors that on the one hand have resulted in the low immunization coverage of both first dose of measles-containing vaccine (MCV1) and second dose (MCV2), on the other has exacerbated the impact of the outbreak (e.g. high levels of acute malnutrition, winter conditions and crowded domestic situation, previous displacement).&nbsp;The 2020 WHO/UNICEF national immunization coverage estimates were 66% for MCV1 and 43% for MCV2. At the sub-national level, administrative coverage data shows that six provinces achieved less than 50% MCV1 coverage (Kandahar 40%; Paktya 38%; Jozjan 37%; Khost 36%; Helmand 18%; Urozgan 3.1%). The internal displacement of 698 000 people in 2021 was another driver of low MCV coverage. Internally displaced persons (IDPs) frequently live in conditions that increase susceptibility to measles (e.g. through less access to immunization services) and may increase measles exposures (e.g. through over-crowding) as well as experiencing poor health outcomes (e.g. due to factors like increasing risk and rates of malnutrition, poor access to curative services). Cross-border travel due to the recent instability in Afghanistan has increased the risk of international spread, particularly in Pakistan and Iran.Overall risk at the national level is assessed as very high due to:Prolonged low      measles vaccination coverage that has led to the accumulation of a large      susceptible population.High number of      internally displaced people.High rates of      malnutrition and vitamin A deficiency which could result in increased      mortality and expected to increase especially in remote areas during the      winter.Inadequate case      management due to a shortage of equipment, supplies, and skilled staff in      health facilities, long and difficult access to health facilities during      the winter period.Barriers to access to      healthcare in the rural population.The regional risk is considered moderate due to the movement of people to Tajikistan, Iran and Pakistan, while at the global level the risk is considered low due to moderately high global MCV coverage estimates. More information is required from neighbouring countries and continued monitoring of displacement trends.",
2022-DON356,dengue---timor-leste,2022-DON356,Assessment,"Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection that is caused by four DENV serotypes (DENV 1, DENV 2, DENV 3 and DENV 4). Aedes aegypti&nbsp;and&nbsp;Aedes&nbsp;albopictus&nbsp;are widely adapted vectors for urban and&nbsp;peri-urban&nbsp;environments.&nbsp;Infection with one serotype provides long-term immunity to the homologous serotype but not to the other serotypes. Sequential infections put people at greater risk for severe dengue. Although dengue in Timor-Leste is not unexpected, the significant daily increase in the number of dengue cases and the rate of hospitalization in the current outbreak are unusual. The number of reported cases between 1 December 2021 to 31 January 2022 is substantially higher compared to the same periods in previous years since 2016. As dengue is endemic in Timor-Leste, the population may be at risk of secondary infection and possible serious complications if not treated promptly and adequately.&nbsp;There is no specific treatment for dengue. Early recognition of dengue virus infection and appropriate clinical management can reduce the severity of disease and mortality among dengue cases. Given the limited health care capacity in-country, poor access to health care, and COVID-19 and other diseases pressuring health capacity, there is a high risk of serious health impacts and an increased number of severe and fatal dengue cases.&nbsp;Co-infections with SARS-CoV-2 and DENV can also be expected.Due to strict international travel restrictions in response to COVID-19, cross-border movement of people is limited. However, international spread by vectors or asymptomatic travellers cannot be ruled out because Timor-Leste shares a land border with Indonesia where dengue is also endemic and the primary vectors are present.&nbsp;",
2022-DON355,cholera-benin,2022-DON355,Assessment,"Cholera is an acute enteric infection caused by the ingestion of&nbsp;V. cholerae&nbsp;bacteria in contaminated water or food. It is mainly linked to insufficient access to safe drinking water and adequate sanitation. It is a potentially serious infectious disease that can cause high morbidity and mortality, which can spread rapidly, depending on the frequency of exposure, the exposed population and the setting.Cholera is endemic in Benin and since 2016, cases continue to be reported every year in various departments across the country. The Parakou district in Borgou department is the epicenter of the current outbreak with high commercial traffic to Cotonou, the capital of Benin. The main factors attributed to the initiation and ongoing spread of the cholera epidemics in Benin include:Inadequate hygiene and sanitationThe lack of public hygiene infrastructureLimited supply of safe drinking water&nbsp; Open defecation The poor practice of hand washing.Additionally, Benin shares international borders with Nigeria and Togo, and there is frequent and substantial cross-border population movement. This poses a risk of cross-border transmission of cholera.Given the porous borders with countries responding to cholera outbreaks and inadequate WASH conditions, the national and regional risks of this outbreak is assessed as high while the risk at the global level is considered to be low.",

The most recently reported case in humans prior to the current case, was in October 2020 in Lao People's Democratic Republic in a one-year-old female who had exposure to backyard poultry (for more details, please see the Disease Outbreak News published on 17 November 2020).&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1 October 2021, there have been 73 poultry cases and 471 detections in individual wild birds of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza A(H5N1)This is the first reported case of human infection of influenza A(H5) infection in the United Kingdom. The case remained clinically asymptomatic. The virus has not been detected beyond this single case. Public health measures from both the human and animal health agencies have been implemented. Based on available information, WHO assesses the risk to the general population posed by this virus to be low and for occupationally exposed persons it is considered to be low-to-moderate. &nbsp;There are no specific vaccines for preventing Influenza A(H5N1) in humans. Candidate vaccines to prevent H5 infection in humans have been developed for pandemic preparedness purposes. Close analysis of the epidemiological situation, further characterization of the most recent viruses (human and poultry) and serological investigations are critical to assess associated risk and to adjust risk management measures in a timely manner.",
2020-DON297,2020-DON297,2020-DON297,Assessment,"All viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, change over time. SARS-CoV-2 strains infecting minks, which are subsequently transmitted to humans, may have acquired unique combinations of mutations. In order to fully understand the impact of specific mutations, advanced laboratory studies are required. These investigations take time and are done in close collaboration between different research groups.The recent findings reported by the Danish Public Health Authority (Statens Serum Institut) in Denmark related to the novel variant of SARS-CoV-2 identified in humans need to be confirmed and further evaluated to better understand any potential implications in terms of transmission, clinical presentation, diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccine development.Furthermore, detailed analyses and scientific studies are needed to better understand the reported mutations. The sharing of full genome sequences of human and animal strains will continue to facilitate detailed analyses by partners. Members of the WHO SARS-CoV-2 Virus Evolution Working Group are working with Danish scientists to better understand the available results and collaborate on further studies. Further scientific and laboratory-based studies will be undertaken to understand the implications of these viruses in terms of available SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines in development.Actions taken by the Danish authorities will limit continued spread of mink-associated variants of SARS-CoV-2 in Denmark, and in particular have been implemented to contain the unique variant reported to WHO. These actions include restricting movement of people, culling animals, widespread testing of people living in affected areas and increased genomic sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 viruses across the country.",

Preliminary investigations have identified environmental samples positive for nCoV in Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan City, however some laboratory-confirmed patients did not report visiting this market. Cases continue to be reported from Wuhan City, and from other provinces in China. Additional investigations are needed to determine how the patients were infected, the extent of human-to-human transmission, the clinical spectrum of disease, and the geographic range of infection.",

2021-DON313,2021-DON313,2021-DON313,Assessment,"Since 2004, avian influenza A(H5) viruses have spread from Asia to Europe via wild birds. The genetic clade 2.3.4.4 H5 viruses have often reassorted among other avian influenza viruses, resulting in avian influenza A(H5N1), A(H5N2), A(H5N3), A(H5N5), A(H5N6) and A(H5N8) viruses, some of which have been detected in birds in many countries .In the Russian Federation, avian influenza A(H5N8) of clade 2.3.4.4 was isolated for the first time in 2014 in a wild bird in the northern region of Russian Far East.As mentioned earlier, all the seven cases with PCR-positive results were clinically asymptomatic. All close contacts of these cases were clinically monitored, and no one showed signs of clinical illness. Infections with avian influenza viruses of the same clade (H5 clade 2.3.4.4) have been reported from China since 2014 in people with exposure to infected birds. The likelihood of human infections with influenza A(H5N8) viruses has been considered to be low.Further genetic and antigenic characterization and information on seroconversion among contacts of the positive cases is required to fully assess the risk.The development of zoonotic influenza candidate vaccine viruses for potential use in human vaccines, coordinated by WHO, remains an essential component of the overall global strategy for influenza pandemic preparedness.Based on currently available information, the risk of human-to-human transmission remains low.",
2021-DON353,yellow-fever---west-and-central-africa,2021-DON353,Assessment,"Yellow fever (YF) is an acute viral disease transmitted by infected mosquitoes (including Aedes sp. and Haemogogus sp). Transmission can be amplified in circumstances where the Aedes mosquitos (day feeder) are present in urban settings and densely populated areas causing a rapid spread of the disease. While many people who become infected do not experience severe symptoms, a subset will develop severe disease. Following a 3-6-day incubation period, cases develop an &ldquo;acute&rdquo; phase illness characterized by fever, muscle pain with a prominent backache, headache, shivers, loss of appetite, nausea and/or vomiting, which resolves within 3-4 days. Approximately 15% of cases enter a second &ldquo;toxic&rdquo; phase within 24 hours of initial remission, which may include high fever, jaundice with or without abdominal pain and vomiting, haemorrhage, and kidney failure, 50% of these cases die within 10 to 14 days. Vaccination is the most important means of preventing the infection. The risk at regional level is assessed as high due to; the active YF virus circulation in these nine high-risk countries (countries or areas where &ldquo; YF has been reported currently or in the past, plus vectors and animal reservoirs currently exist&rdquo;). increased population movement, including a vulnerable nomadic population that is not covered by routine immunization and undocumented border crossings with risk of spread regionally and beyond the AFRO region; potential risk of outbreaks in urban settings, such as Abidjan, Cote D&rsquo;Ivoire or Lagos, Nigeria which are a real threat to regional and international spread; YF clusters located in mixed, urban and agriculture / forest territories (e.g. central Abidjan, Cote d Ivoire) highlighting the persistent risk of YF spill over into an urban area with marked cross reactivity with other circulating flaviviruses which complicates the final interpretation of laboratory results; the affected countries are part of the savannah region with similar ecosystems (forest and shrub land) and a variety of animals including non-human primates (monkeys), that are the primary wild hosts of the YF virus. The ecosystem is also conducive for the Aedes mosquito, which is the vector for YF, and has been involved in the savannah transmission cycle that connects the sylvatic and urban cycles of both humans and primates; suboptimal YF surveillance within the affected countries due to weak health systems and conflicts which delay investigation of probable cases of YF, leading to a likely underestimation of the actual number of cases and the severity of the outbreaks; decreased routine immunization coverages in countries with history of previous YF vaccination campaigns; with a downward trend in coverages over the last decade (72% average in 2010- 65% in 2020); YF preventive vaccination campaigns delayed in countries such as Nigeria, DRC or yet to be planned (Ethiopia, Chad and Niger); concurrent outbreaks (cholera, meningitis, malaria, circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2), chikungunya, leishmaniasis, plague, Lassa fever etc) and the COVID-19 pandemic that might hamper surveillance and the response. The overall risk at the global level is considered low, as no cases related to this current outbreak have been reported outside of the African region, at this stage. However, there are favourable ecosystems for YF outside the African region and there might be challenges in the surveillance and immunization capacities due to potential onward transmission, if not timely detected. More than 2 billion individuals in Asia live in areas where the competent vectors A. aegypti and A. albopictus are present. The expansion of global air travel and the rapid ecological and demographic changes increase the risk of YF introductions into Asia. Based on the interconnectivity with endemic countries, studies have suggested China, India, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia are at the greatest risk of YF introduction; however, the risk of autochthonous transmission is unknown. There is a risk of outbreaks in urban settings, introduced by viraemic travellers to largely unprotected urban populations such as Lagos (Nigeria), N&rsquo;Djamena (Chad) or Bangui (CAR), with continued risk of rapid amplification internationally.&nbsp;The impact on public health will persist until the ongoing outbreaks are controlled, YF vaccination coverage is high and immunity gaps in the population are closed. The importation of cases to countries with suboptimal coverage and persisting population immunity gaps poses a high risk to the Region and may jeopardize the tremendous efforts invested to achieve elimination.",
2021-DON350,hepatitis-e-virus-republic-of-south-sudan,2021-DON350,Assessment,"Hepatitis E is a liver disease caused by the hepatitis E virus, transmitted by the faecal-oral route, mainly through contaminated water. It can lead to serious public health impacts particularly among special populations: those in IDP camps and pregnant women. Risk factors for HEV are linked to poor sanitation conditions, allowing viruses excreted in the stools of infected individuals to enter water intended for human consumption. Usually, the infection resolves spontaneously within 2 to 6 weeks, with a case fatality ratio (CFR) of 0.5-4%. In rare cases, acute hepatitis E can be severe and progress to fulminant hepatitis (acute liver failure). Generally, CFR for pregnant women is reported to be higher than the overall CFR for HEV infections, reaching 25%. Displaced persons and refugees experience the highest attack rates when outbreaks occur given the overcrowded nature of their living conditions and poor hygiene situation.Cases of HEV have consistently been reported from Bentiu IDP camp since 2014 but have risen and surpassed epidemic threshold levels in 2021. The overall risk at the global level remains low, while at the national level is assessed as high due to:Poor sanitation and hygiene practices especially in the Bentiu IDP camp and limited availability of safe drinking water.Limited access to essential medical services in the Bentiu IDP camp and surrounding area. The overall population movements in the affected area, and the presence of large internally displaced population, with a worsening situation due to the ongoing flooding, and the influx of new IDPs that might increase the risk of HEV spread.The ongoing floods have impacted the implementation of response activities pausing the HEV vaccination response and consequently increasing the risk of death in high-risk individuals including pregnant women. It has also exacerbated the already-existing poor hygiene conditions in the Bentiu IDP camp.As the affected area is close to the border with Sudan and Ethiopia, at the regional level the overall risk is considered moderate due to the presence of the mobile IDP populations and refugees that cross these borders. While there have been fewer documented refugees coming from Ethiopia into South Sudan, a significant amount of traffic occurs for people heading to Sudan, particularly from Rubkona county - where the Bentiu IDP camp is located - to Khartoum, the capital of Sudan.Additionally, there is a current outbreak of HEV at the border with South Darfur state in Sudan, that poses potential risk of cross-border spread.",
2021-DON351,2021-DON351,2021-DON351,Assessment,"The current re-emergence of EVD is the fifth outbreak in less than three years.

In addition, it is not unusual for sporadic cases to occur following a major&nbsp;outbreak. The Ebola virus can persist in certain body fluids of EVD survivors. In a limited number of cases, secondary transmissions resulting from exposure to survivors' body fluids have occurred. Therefore, maintaining collaborative relationships with survivor associations while monitoring survivors is a priority to mitigate any potential risk.Re-emergence of EVD is a major public health issue in the DRC and there are gaps in the country&rsquo;s capacity to prepare for and respond to outbreaks. A confluence of environmental and socioeconomic factors including poverty, community mistrust, weak health systems, and political instability is accelerating the rate of the emergence of EVD in the DRC.WHO considers that ongoing challenges in terms of access and security, epidemiological surveillance, coupled with the emergence of COVID-19, as well as ongoing outbreaks such as cholera and measles might jeopardize the country&rsquo;s ability to rapidly detect and respond to the re-emergence.

2021-DON349,cholera-cameroon,2021-DON349,Assessment,"Cholera is an acute enteric infection caused by the ingestion of Vibrio cholerae bacteria present in contaminated water or food. In its severe form, it can lead to severe dehydration and death within hours if left untreated. It is primarily linked to insufficient access to safe water and adequate sanitation. It has the potential to spread rapidly, depending on the frequency of exposure, the population exposed, and the context.Cholera is endemic in Cameroon. Since 2018, cholera outbreaks have been reported annually in various regions of the country including in the currently affected regions (South-West, Centre and Littoral). Several risk factors concur with the circulation of Vibrio cholera in the country, including limited access to safe drinking water and health care facilities in the affected areas of the South-West region and in the capital city of Yaound&eacute;, as well as cultural practices that contribute to unsafe WASH conditions.The Biyem-Assi health district in the Centre region is a densely populated area with insufficient access to safe drinking water and sanitation, that is located in the heart of the capital city Yaound&egrave;. This may allow a cholera outbreak to spread quickly if swift control measures are not implemented.The affected health districts in the South-West region (Ekondo Titi, Bakassi and Mobonge) belong to an archipelago in a humanitarian crisis zone with an ongoing armed conflict, and the risk of cholera exportation to other neighbouring districts cannot be excluded. Security constraints, limited geographic accessibility of some areas, and suboptimal communication networks lead to irregular epidemiological updates and potential underreporting of cases. The populations have no or limited access to safe drinking water and latrines, and the overall hygienic conditions are inadequate. There is limited access to health care and patients may have to travel long distances by boat to seek care. In addition, the affected South-West region borders Nigeria, and there is a frequent and substantial cross-border population movement. In the northern areas, Cameroon is bordered by Adamawa, Borno and Taraba states of Nigeria which are currently affected by a cholera outbreak. There is also a risk of further international spread especially to the Republic of Chad which borders both Nigeria and Cameroon. Therefore, the risk at the national and regional levels is assessed as high. At the global level, the risk is considered low.",

2021-DON345,middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-(mers-cov)-united-arab-emirates,2021-DON345,Assessment,"Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a viral respiratory infection of humans and dromedary camels which is caused by a coronavirus called Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus. Infection with MERS-CoV can cause severe disease resulting in high mortality. Approximately 35% of patients with MERS-CoV have died, but this may be an overestimate of the true mortality rate, as mild cases of MERS-CoV may be missed by existing surveillance systems and until more is known about the disease, the case fatality rates are counted only amongst the laboratory-confirmed cases.Humans are infected with MERS-CoV from direct or indirect contact with dromedaries who are the natural host and zoonotic source of MERS-CoV infection. MERS-CoV has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans but it has, so far, mainly occurred in health care settings and to a limited extent among close contacts. The notification of this additional case does not change the overall risk assessment. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East and/or other countries where MERS-CoV is circulating in dromedaries, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who were exposed to the virus through contact with dromedaries or animal products (for example, consumption of camel&rsquo;s raw milk), or in a healthcare setting. WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessments based on the latest available information. However, with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the testing capacities for MERS-CoV have been severely affected in some countries since most of the resources are redirected to prevent and control the pandemic. From September 2012 until 18 November 2021, the cumulative number of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection cases reported globally to WHO is 2,583 with 888 associated deaths. The majority of these cases have occurred in the Arabian Peninsula, with one large outbreak outside this region in the Republic of Korea in May 2015, when 186 laboratory-confirmed cases (185 in Republic of Korea and one in China) and 38 deaths were reported. The global number reflects the cumulative number of laboratory-confirmed cases reported to WHO under the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) to date. The number of deaths includes the deaths that WHO is aware of to date through follow-up with affected Member States.",
2021-DON356,circulating-vaccine-derived-poliovirus-type-2-(cvdpv2)-yemen,2021-DON356,Assessment,"The risk of further spread of this strain in Yemen is exacerbated by decreased immunization rates during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the detected cases are from two governorates with accessibility and security issues, with high risk of population displacement to other governorates due to the recent security situation in Marib and Western Coast of Yemen which has led to&nbsp; significant levels of population movement, including to and from the Horn of Africa. The ongoing humanitarian crisis is a major risk factor to be considered for the spread of the disease.Based on the above-mentioned gaps and challenges, WHO considers the risk of international spread and/or emergence of cVDPV2 to be high. &nbsp;Additionally, the existing cVDPV1 outbreak as well as the emergence of cVDPV2 highlight the gaps in routine immunization coverage and inadequate outbreak response.The Emergency Committee under the IHR (2005) convened a meeting in November 2021 on the international spread of poliovirus in multiple countries. As per the report released, the Emergency Committee expressed concern at the continued rapid spread of cVDPV2 to many countries and noted that the risk of international spread of cVDPV2 is currently high.&nbsp;",
2021-DON355,yellow-fever---ghana,2021-DON355,Assessment,"The overall risk of YF from this event at the national, regional and global levels are assessed as moderate, moderate and low, respectively. YF is an acute viral disease transmitted by infected mosquitoes (including Aedes spp. and Haemogogus spp.). A subset of people who become infected with YF experience severe symptoms. Approximately 15% of the cases enter the second toxic phase within 24 hours of the initial remission. The second toxic phase may be characterized by fever, jaundice, with or without abdominal pain, vomiting haemorrhage and kidney failure. Of these, 20-50% die within 10 to 14 days. Vaccination offers lifelong immunity and is considered to be the most important means of preventing YF, while other strategies such as vector control are complementary. There is no specific treatment for YF, and cases receive supportive care for complications such as dehydration, renal failure and fever.The national risk was assessed as moderate due to the following reasons: Suboptimal vaccination coverage in some nomadic settlements could result in continued transmission;The outbreak is marked by predominantly affecting communities of nomadic settlers, a mobile and migratory population who may be unvaccinated, or move from areas with low population immunity and YF transmission;Large portions of affected districts are in the forest reserve, and some of the affected communities are located on the fringes of the Mole National Park where there is a presence of animals including non-human primates, the primary wild hosts of YF virus, and Aedes mosquitos, the vector for YF in Africa. These hosts and vectors are involved in the savannah transmission cycle that connects the sylvatic and urban cycles of humans and monkeys; andThe COVID-19 pandemic may impact response activities for YF.The regional risk was assessed as moderate due to the favorable ecosystem in the neighboring countries and porous borders. The global risk was assessed as low, however, the Mole National Park which is located in both North and West Gonja Districts is visited by tourists, therefore there could be a risk of exportation of the virus.",
2021-DON344,2021-DON344,2021-DON344,Assessment,"Monkeypox is a sylvatic zoonosis with incidental human infections that usually occur sporadically in forested parts of Central and West Africa. It is caused by the monkeypox virus (MPXV) that belongs to the&nbsp;Orthopoxvirus&nbsp;family. Genomic sequencing shows there are two monkeypox clades &ndash; Congo Basin and West African&nbsp;and there have been observed differences in human pathogenicity and mortality in the two geographic areas. Both clades can be transmitted by contact and droplet exposure via exhaled large droplets or contact with fomites such as bedding; infection can be fatal in humans. The incubation period for monkeypox is usually from 6 to 13 days but can range from 5 to 21 days. The disease is often self-limiting with signs and symptoms usually resolving spontaneously within two to four weeks. Signs and symptoms can be mild or severe, and lesions can be painful. Immune deficiency, young age, and pregnancy appear to be risk factors for severe disease. The case fatality ratio (CFR) for the West African clade has been reported to be around 1%. The recent outbreak in Nigeria recorded a higher CFR related to underlying conditions which may lead to immunodeficiency. A case fatality ratio of up to 11% (in individuals without prior smallpox vaccination) has been reported for the Congo basin clade. Since 2017, a monkeypox outbreak has been occurring in Nigeria with 218 cases confirmed to date. In addition to Nigeria, outbreaks have also been reported in nine other countries in central and western Africa since 1970. These include Cameroon, Central African Republic, Cote d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gabon, Liberia, Republic of Congo, Sierra Leone, and Sudan. Sporadic small outbreaks continue to occur in some of these countries including Cameroon and the Central African Republic. However, the vast majority of cases continue to be reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, with 2780 cases and 72 deaths (CFR 2.6%) reported between 1 January through 31 October 2021. While a new vaccine has been approved for the prevention of monkeypox, and traditional smallpox vaccine has been demonstrated to provide protection, these vaccines are not widely available. Increased susceptibility of humans to monkeypox is thought to be related to waning immunity due to cessation of smallpox immunization. Contact with live and dead animals through hunting and consumption of wild game or use of animal-derived products are presumed sources of human infection. Milder cases of monkeypox in adults could go undetected, misdiagnosed, or unreported and represent a risk of human-to-human transmission.There is likely to be little immunity to infection in those exposed as endemic disease is geographically limited to West and Central Africa and populations worldwide under the age of 40 or 50 years no longer benefit from the protection afforded by prior smallpox vaccination programmes. There is no specific treatment for monkeypox disease, and care is symptom-based optimal care. In some circumstances, treatment approved for smallpox may be offered on a compassionate or emergency use basis.",

Although AFP surveillance is sensitive enough to detect paralytic cases, poliovirus transmission may continue undetected. The risk of international spread of this virus is currently assessed as low due to the relatively high immunization coverage and sanitary infrastructure in neighboring countries, particularly Belarus, Hungary, and Slovakia.

2021-DON339,zika-virus-disease-india,2021-DON339,Assessment,"ZIKV can cause large epidemics with a substantial demand on the public health system including surveillance, case management, and laboratory capacity to differentiate ZIKV disease from illness due to co-circulating mosquito-borne viruses like dengue and chikungunya. Although 60-80% of the Zika virus infected cases are asymptomatic or only have mild symptoms, ZIKV can cause microcephaly, congenital Zika syndrome (CZS) and GBS. Moreover, although ZIKV is primarily transmitted by Aedes species mosquitoes, it can also be transmitted from mother to foetus during pregnancy, through sexual contact, transfusion of blood and blood products, and organ transplantation. In India, ZIKV disease cases/infections have been detected in Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan states in 2018 (South-East Asian lineage), but no ZIKV-associated microcephaly has been reported. Although this event is not unexpected, given the wide distribution of the primary mosquito vector, Aedes aegypti, and competent vector, Aedes albopictus, in Kerala and Maharashtra states, this is unusual as it is the first time that ZIKV disease cases have been confirmed in these states.The overall risk is considered low at the regional level and global level, while at the national level (Kerala and Maharashtra States) is currently assessed as moderate, given that:The actual ZIKV transmission might be higher due to the undetermined population immunity in the two affected states and the asymptomatic clinical presentation in most of the ZIKV infections;The primary vector Aedes aegypti, and competent vector Aedes albopictus, are established in the area, often in high densities, and the ecological conditions are favourable for ZIKV transmission and potential endemicity;The current evidence suggests that the main source of infection is due to vector-borne transmission; however, epidemiological and entomological investigations are ongoing and the outbreak magnitude might change;Although appropriate control measures have been implemented, and travel is currently limited under COVID-19 pandemic conditions, further spread of the disease cannot be excluded through asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic infected persons;The ongoing monsoon season could increase the vector density and the likelihood of further transmission via mosquitos;Kerala is a tourist destination with frequent travel to and from other areas of the country and other countries; however, there are current travel restrictions because of the COVID-19 pandemic.The exportation within India and to other states and countries cannot be ruled out due the presence of competent vector (Ae. aegypti) in other states where mosquitos can become infected by biting infected returning travellers leading to potential further spread of the disease.The region as a whole remains at risk for ZIKV transmission because of the presence of competent vectors, often in high densities and vector control activities might have been interrupted in other countries because of the pandemic.",
2021-DON341,yellow-fever---bolivarian-republic-of-venezuela,2021-DON341,Assessment,"Yellow fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic disease caused by the yellow fever virus (YFV) and is transmitted by infected mosquitoes of the genera&nbsp;Haemagogus&nbsp;and&nbsp;Sabethes, as well as the urban mosquito species&nbsp;Aedes aegypti.&nbsp; Yellow fever infects humans and non-human primates (NHP) and has the potential to spread rapidly and cause serious public health impact in unimmunized populations. Vaccination is the most important means of preventing the infection as the disease is preventable with a single dose of yellow fever vaccine which provides immunity for life. While there is no specific treatment, supportive care to treat dehydration, respiratory failure and fever and antibiotic treatment for associated bacterial infections can reduce mortality and is recommended. Viraemic cases should stay under mosquito nets during the day to limit the risk of spread to others through bites of mosquitoes, and vector control strategies may complement particularly during outbreaks.Venezuela is considered high risk for yellow fever with endemic virus transmission and is a priority country for the global Eliminate Yellow fever Epidemics (EYE) strategy. Vaccination coverage is suboptimal, creating a high risk for onward transmission and amplification of yellow fever among unvaccinated populations. The increased number of human cases and epizootics since August 2021, is concerning due to the persistence of high viral circulation. Since November 2020, when the vaccination campaign began in prioritized states, 82% immunization coverage has been achieved, with five out of the 10 states with 100% coverage (Amazonas, Apure, Delta Amacuro, Sucre and T&aacute;chira). The remaining five states vary in vaccine coverage (Anzo&aacute;tegui 97.2%, Gu&aacute;rico 95.5%, Bol&iacute;var 78.9%, Monagas 67.7%, and Zulia 44.7%). The state where the outbreak has occurred, Monagas state, has low vaccination coverage which suggests a significant population remains at-risk with a necessity to intensify risk communications among high-risk groups.Despite the significant efforts made to vaccinate a large portion of the population, the increasing number of human cases and the persistence and geographical spread of epizootics among NHP illustrate the potential risk of further spread to areas where YF immunization coverage is low. Special attention should also be placed on specific at-risk groups and ethnic minorities. There is a long-standing pattern of movements of indigenous people across borders among settlements of the same culture, including to neighbouring Trinidad and Tobago. According to the International Organization for Migration[i], the flow of Warao people moving from their villages in Venezuela to Brazil, to Guyana and possibly to Suriname has increased dramatically since 2017 and persisted during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Monagas State and national level governments along with the PAHO/WHO field team carried out activities to intensify surveillance among NHPs and entomological populations, as well as vector control in urban areas. However, epizootic and entomological surveillance needs to be strengthened in the affected and surrounding areas where human cases were detected.&nbsp;The yellow fever outbreak in Venezuela is occurring in the context of a major and complex situation, which includes the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic creates a risk of disruption access to health care due to COVID-19 related burdens on the health system, lack of health workers along with decreased vaccination demand due to physical distancing requirements or community reluctance. The capacity of local laboratories and national reference laboratories may also be compromised due to the increased demand in processing COVID-19 samples. As of 13 October, Venezuela reported 384 668 COVID 19 cases and 4634 deaths, and currently is among the eight countries with the highest number of COVID-19 new cases in the last 24 hours in the Region of the Americas. All yellow fever endemic and high risk regions and territories are also experiencing ongoing transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the addition of YFV as a co-circulating virus could pose an additional challenge for case management and infection and prevention control activities if there was a large scale yellow fever outbreak in Venezuela or neighbouring countries.WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and review the risk assessment based on the latest available information.[i] IOM, Brazil Launch National Survey on Indigenous People from Venezuela.",

2021-DON336,2021-DON336,2021-DON336,Assessment,"Nigeria is a high-risk country for yellow fever and is recognized as a high priority country to the global Eliminate Yellow Fever Epidemics (EYE) Strategy. The re-emergence of yellow fever in September 2017 in Nigeria has been marked by outbreaks over a wide geographical area. A combination of vaccination and vector control strategies is the most important means of preventing infection. Yellow fever is endemic in Nigeria and, due to suboptimal immunization coverage in most states and nationwide, the risk of spread is high. Entomological investigations have confirmed the presence of the vectors, Aedes aegypti and Aedes africanus in several states across the country.
Given the low routine immunization coverage, coupled with the poor performance of reactive mass immunization activities, indicate an ongoing risk in susceptible populations and thus, a risk of serious public health impact.
To address the risk, the country has engaged in a multi-year plan to complete preventive mass vaccination campaigns targeting all eligible persons aged 9 months to 44-year-old, supported through the EYE and global partners. Since 2017, a total of 22 of 36 states including FCT have completed these campaigns. National and State public health authorities are currently responding to several concurrent outbreaks (COVID-19 pandemic, Lassa fever, and a widespread cholera epidemic), which are straining the available limited resources, especially human resources to conduct investigations and response activities.

The favorable season for transmission of the disease generally lasts from September to April. Cases are usually reported from the central highlands of the country, located at an altitude of over 700 meters, as is the situation with the current outbreak involving the regions of Itasy and Haute Matsiatra. Between 200 and 400 cases of plague are usually notified each year by the Ministry of Public Health, mainly in the bubonic form.The country experienced an epidemic of pneumonic plague in 2017, which was unusual because of its magnitude and its urban character affecting major cities of the country.This form of plague is very severe and almost always fatal if it is not treated promptly. It develops either by inhaling respiratory droplets from an infected person or as a result of untreated bubonic plague after the bacteria have spread to the lungs.Madagascar has a long history of responding to plague outbreaks. It has already adopted several prevention and response plans, such as the National Strategy for the Prevention and Control of Plague. Unfortunately, the weak financial capacity of the country prevents the establishment of an adequate preparedness and response strategy. The existence of other epidemics like COVID-19 and the ongoing humanitarian nutrition and food crisis in the south of the country are straining the health system and reducing the country's capacity to cope with other crises. The affected areas are geographically close to the capital of the country and the movement of the population increases the risk of spreading the disease to urban areas and other areas of the country.Thus, the risk at the national level is considered high, while at the regional and global levels this risk is low since there is no known history of exporting plague cases to other countries. Additionally, as Madagascar is an island country, the implementation of response measures is particularly effective at preventing the export of cases.",
2021-DON337,nipah-virus-disease---india,2021-DON337,Assessment,"Nipah virus disease is an emerging zoonotic disease of public health importance in the WHO South East Asia and Western Pacific Regions, where Pteropus fruit bats, the natural host of the virus, are widespread. It was first identified during an outbreak in Malaysia in 1998, and all subsequent outbreaks have occurred in parts of Asia (India, Bangladesh, Malaysia and Singapore). Transmission can occur from direct contact with infected animals, consuming contaminated food products or through close contact with an infected person. Previous outbreaks had a seasonal pattern with occurrence during winter and spring, associated with several factors such as the breeding season of the bats, increased virus shedding by bats and fruit harvesting season. The case fatality ratio ranges from 40 to 100%.In India, the first Nipah virus disease outbreak was reported in Siliguri town in 2001, followed by a second outbreak in Nadia district in 2007, both in West Bengal state. In 2018, an outbreak was reported in Kozhikode district, and in 2019, another outbreak in Kochi district, both in Kerala state. Bats from the Pteropus spp. were the probable source of the 2018 outbreak in Kerala state.The current isolated case was reported in a rural area in Kerala state where an outbreak was previously reported in 2018. India has experienced and contained Nipah virus disease outbreaks in the past and has demonstrated the capacity to carry out outbreak control activities, including case identification, laboratory testing, case management, contact tracing and risk communication. This event is an isolated case and the risk is low at national level and low at the regional level.",
2021-DON334,2021-DON334,2021-DON334,Assessment,"Since 2015, the Democratic Republic of the Congo has reported a high number of suspected cases of meningitis. Parts of the country lie within the African meningitis belt&nbsp;[1], where bacterial meningitis is endemic and also experiences epidemics, with 6000 to 10,000 suspected cases reported annually. However, only a very small proportion (0-2%) of cases are laboratory confirmed each year. From 1 January to 1 August 2021, the DRC reported a cumulative total of 3,842 suspected cases including 189 deaths, representing a case-fatality ratio of 5%. In Tshopo Province, which is in the African meningitis belt, the last meningitis epidemic was reported in November 2009, with 214 cases and 18 deaths (case-fatality ratio of 8%). In May 2016, the province organised a preventive vaccination campaign against meningitis A during which almost 1.7 million people aged between 1 and 29 years were vaccinated. Since then, passive surveillance has been implemented in the province as part of integrated disease surveillance. Meningococcal meningitis is associated with a high case-fatality ratio (up to 50% when left untreated) and a high incidence (over 10%) of severe sequelae. The current event has already affected 608 people , with 161 deaths. The number of cases and deaths is expected to increase given the infectiousness and lethality of bacterial meningitis.&nbsp; Logistical challenges, in addition to accessing and communicating with many areas within the health zone, further prevents implementation of an adequate response.&nbsp; Additionally, the country is responding to the COVID-19 pandemic which is impacting the health systems and disease surveillance capacities; and the existence of other ongoing epidemics in the country is limiting resources for the response to the meningitis outbreak.At the national level, there is a high risk of the disease spreading to other health zones and to the city of Kisangani, the capital of Tschopo province, due to the movement of people between the affected area and other parts of the country. At the regional level, the risk is assessed to be moderate due to the cross-border movements between the populations of the Central African Republic and the Tshopo province, and more than 100 mining sites in Banalia where people from neighbouring provinces and the Central African Republic travel for work. Although cross-border measures against COVID-19 may limit the travel and also enhance detection of symptomatic cases.The risk at global level is assessed to be low.

2021-DON335,marburg-virus-disease---guinea,2021-DON335,Assessment,"Marburg virus disease (MVD) is an epidemic-prone disease associated with high case fatality ratios (CFR 24-90%). In the early course of the disease, clinical diagnosis of MVD is difficult to distinguish from many other tropical febrile illnesses, because of the similarities in the clinical symptoms. Other viral hemorrhagic fevers need to be excluded, particularly Ebola virus disease (EVD), as well as malaria, typhoid fever, leptospirosis, rickettsial infection and plague. MVD is transmitted by direct contact with the blood, bodily fluids and/or tissues of infected persons or wild animals (e.g., monkeys and fruit bats).Investigations are ongoing to identify the source of the infection. Guinea has previous experience in managing viral hemorrhagic diseases such as EVD and Lassa fever, but this was the first time that MVD was reported. The country has a fragile health care system due to the overburden of disease outbreaks, COVID-19 pandemic, and the recurrent threat of epidemics such as malaria, yellow fever, measles, Lassa fever, EVD, health care-associated infections, high rates of acute malnutrition, cyclical natural disasters such as floods, and socio-political unrest. Guinea health authorities responded rapidly to the event, and measures were rapidly implemented to control the outbreak. Cross-border population movement and community mixing between Guinea and neighboring Sierra Leone and Liberia increased the risk of cross-border spread. Sierra Leone and Liberia health authorities activated contingency plans and started public health measures at the points of entry with Guinea.The affected village is in a remote forest area located at the border with Sierra Leone, about 9 km from a main international border crossing point between the two countries. The proximity of the affected area to an international border, cross-border movement between the affected district and Sierra Leone, and the potential transmission of the virus between bat colonies and humans posed an increased risk for cross-border spread.These factors suggested a high risk at the national and regional level, and given that Gu&eacute;ck&eacute;dou prefecture is well connected to Foya in Liberia, and Kailahun in Sierra Leone, this outbreak required an immediate and coordinated response with support from international partners. The risk associated with the event at the global level was assessed as low.",
2021-DON333,2021-DON333,2021-DON333,Assessment,"Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a viral respiratory infection of humans and dromedary camels which is caused by a coronavirus called Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Infection with MERS-CoV can cause severe disease resulting in high mortality. Approximately 35% of patients with MERS have died, but this may be an overestimate of the true mortality rate, as mild cases of MERS-CoV may be missed by existing surveillance systems and until more is known about the disease, the case fatality rates are counted only amongst the laboratory-confirmed cases. Humans are infected with MERS-CoV from direct or indirect contact with dromedaries who are the natural host and zoonotic source of the MERS-CoV infection. MERS-CoV has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans. So far, the observed non-sustained human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts and in health care settings.&nbsp;Outside of the healthcare setting there has been limited human-to human transmission. The notification of those additional cases does not change the overall risk assessment. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East and/or other countries where MERS-CoV is circulating in dromedaries, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who were exposed to the virus through contact with dromedaries, or animal products (for example, consumption of &nbsp;raw camel&rsquo;s milk), or in a healthcare setting.WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information. However, with the current COVID-19 pandemic, the testing capacities for MERS-CoV have been severely affected in many countries since most of the resources are redirected to prevent and control the current COVID-19 pandemic. The Ministry of Health of Saudi Arabia is working to increase the testing capacities for better detection of MERS-CoV infections.",
2021-DON332,human-infection-with-avian-influenza-a(h5n1)-ｰ-india,2021-DON332,Assessment,"Available information and initial field investigations suggest that no additional cases have been suspected, indicating a low likelihood of human-to-human transmission. Further sporadic cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H5) viruses may be reported because these viruses have been occasionally detected in poultry populations in India. The risk assessment will be reviewed as necessary, should further epidemiological or virological information become available.India has reported outbreaks of avian influenza A(H5N1) in poultry farms every year since it was first reported in a poultry farm in Maharashtra State in February 2006. In January and February 2021, Haryana state reported an outbreak of avian influenza A(H5N8) in Panchkula district, which severely affected poultry in the area. In that outbreak, samples collected from birds from four poultry farms tested positive for avian influenza A(H5N8). Should infected individuals from affected areas travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during travel or after arrival. If this were to occur, further community level spread is considered unlikely as this virus has not acquired the ability to transmit easily among humans.",

In the early course of the disease, clinical diagnosis of MVD is difficult to distinguish from other tropical febrile illnesses, because of the similarities in the clinical symptoms. Differential diagnoses to be excluded include, Ebola virus disease, as well as malaria, typhoid fever, leptospirosis, rickettsial infection, and plague. MVD is transmitted by direct contact with the blood, bodily fluids and/or tissues of infected persons or wild animals (e.g. monkeys and fruit bats). Currently, there is no specific therapeutic or drug approved for MVD. Nevertheless, supportive care including: close monitoring of vital signs, fluid resuscitation, electrolyte and acid base monitoring along with management of co-infections and organ dysfunction, are critical components of  care and optimize patient outcomes and survival. Some monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) are under development and other antivirals are being explored for MVD (e.g. Galidesvir, Favipiravir, Remdesivir) as part of clinical trials, but without clear results in the current moment more evidence and further studies are required. However, these should only be used as part of a randomized controlled trial.As of 7 August, only one case has been confirmed and all four identified high-risk close contacts are asymptomatic. Investigations are ongoing to identify the source of the infection and  additional contacts of the index case.Guinea has previous experience in managing recurring viral hemorrhagic diseases such as EVD and Lassa fever, but this is the first time that MVD has been reported. The country has a fragile healthcare system which is further exacerbated by multiple disease outbreaks, recurrent epidemics and the COVID-19 pandemic. The response activities to recent outbreaks such as EVD, COVID-19 and Lassa fever likely contributed to early detection and response to Marburg Virus Disease in Guinea.Guinea&rsquo;s health authorities have responded rapidly to this event, and measures are being quickly implemented to control the outbreak. The affected village is in a remote forested area located near the border with Sierra Leone and Liberia. Cross-border population movement and community mixing between Guinea and neighboring Sierra Leone and Liberia may increase the risk of cross-border spread and as such, the Ministry of Health and Sanitation has proactively assessed the situation together with stakeholders and the district health leadership in Kono and Kailahun districts of Sierra Leone have been alerted. Health authorities in Sierra Leone and Liberia have activated contingency plans and have started public health measures at the points of entry with Guinea. Additionally the potential transmission of the virus between bat colonies and humans also pose an increased risk for cross-border spread.These factors suggest a high risk at the national level, requiring an immediate and coordinated response with support from international partners. The risk at the regional level is high, based on the fact that the Gu&eacute;ck&eacute;dou prefecture is well connected to Liberia and Sierra Leone, although authorities are already taking action.

2021-DON330,monkeypox---the-united-states-of-america,2021-DON330,Assessment,"Monkeypox is a sylvatic zoonosis with incidental human infections that usually occur sporadically in forested parts of Central and West Africa. It is caused by the monkeypox virus (MPXV) that belongs to the Orthopoxvirus family. Genomic sequencing shows there are two monkeypox clades &ndash; Congo Basin and West African &ndash; consistent with observed differences in human pathogenicity and fatality in the two geographic areas. Both clades can be transmitted by contact and droplet exposure via exhaled large droplets, or via fomites such as bedding, and can be fatal in humans.The incubation period for monkeypox is usually from 6 to 13 days but can range from 5 to 21 days.&nbsp; The disease is often self-limiting with symptoms usually resolving spontaneously within 14-21 days. Symptoms can be mild or severe, and lesions can be painful and become itchy. Although the West African clade of monkeypox virus infection generally causes mild disease, it may lead to severe illness in some individuals. The case fatality rate for the West African clade is around 1% while it may be as high as 10% for the Congo Basin clade. Immune deficiency appears to be a risk factors for severe disease. Children are also at higher risk and monkeypox during pregnancy may lead to complications, congenital monkeypox or stillbirth.Milder cases of monkeypox may go undetected and represent a risk of person-to-person transmission. There is likely to be little immunity to the infection in those travelling and exposed as endemic disease is geographically limited to parts of West and Central Africa.While a vaccine has been approved for prevention of monkeypox, and traditional smallpox vaccine also provides protection, these vaccines are not widely available and populations worldwide under the age of 40 or 50 years no longer benefit from the protection afforded by prior smallpox vaccination programmes.&nbsp; Increased susceptibility to monkeypox is in part related to waning immunity due to cessation of smallpox immunization.The animal reservoir remains unknown, although is likely to be among small mammals. Contact with live and dead animals through hunting and consumption of wild game or bush meat are presumed drivers of human infection.&nbsp;",

As mentioned above, the third confirmed case is an extended close contact of the previous two cases and all cases are from the same household and have fully recovered. No additional contacts have been identified linked to this new case. None of the close contacts have travelled outside the United Kingdom following exposure. Therefore, this case does not change the public health risk in the country and the chance of further disease spread remains low.

2021-DON328,2021-DON328,2021-DON328,Assessment,"Detection of EVD cases is not unexpected in Guinea given that the virus is enzootic in some animal populations in the country and can persist in certain body fluids of survivors. In a limited number of cases, secondary transmissions resulting from exposure to survivor&rsquo;s body fluids have been documented in previous outbreaks. Investigations into the source of this outbreak using genomic sequencing, &nbsp;demonstrated that the identified 2021 virus lineage was very closely related to a virus circulating in Guinea in 2014. However, the index case in this outbreak was not a known survivor of the 2014-2016 outbreak. They were however a health worker who is known to be at an increased risk of contracting EVD when infection prevention and control measures are not fully practiced as was likely in this situation. In-depth epidemiological investigations into the source of this outbreak have not drawn conclusive hypotheses to date, as to where and how the index case was infected. Thus, Investigations remain ongoing and a risk of additional undetected cases remains. A functioning surveillance system is key to detect cases of EVD however throughout this outbreak the surveillance system met several challenges. For example, only nine (39%) of the 23 cases were known contacts at the time of detection indicating that case investigation and contact listing was not comprehensive. Additionally, the alert system reported a suboptimal numbers of alerts and faced difficulties to investigate and test suspect cases of EVD. Neighboring prefectures of Nz&eacute;r&eacute;kor&eacute; also reported few alerts, even fewer of which were validated and tested demonstrating the challenges faced with surveillance in these remote hard-to-reach areas. Therefore, although 42 days after the last confirmed case tested negative for the second time the outbreak has been declared over (as per WHO recommendations) there remains a possibility that there are unrecognized chains of transmission in the community.WHO considers that ongoing challenges of access and epidemiological surveillance, coupled with the emergence of COVID-19 and a recent yellow fever outbreak, might challenge the country&rsquo;s ability to rapidly detect and respond to a new EVD outbreak.",

Prior to this report, there was also one case of nosocomial transmission in a health worker in England in 2018 due to contact with contaminated bed linen. In the present case, the first patient was under quarantine with family members due to COVID-19 restrictions for a period of ten days after arrival in the country and an additional two days. Contacts possibly exposed are being monitored.&nbsp; Once monkeypox was suspected, authorities in the United Kingdom promptly initiated appropriate public health measures, including isolation of the case and contact tracing. The second individual was isolating at home until onset of the rash and in hospital care thereafter. The risk of potential onward spread in the country is minimized.In 2017, Nigeria began to experience its first outbreak in 40 years. From the first cases in September 2017 to November 2019, a total of 183 confirmed cases and 9 deaths were recorded in&nbsp;&nbsp; 18 states (Rivers, Bayelsa, Cross River, Imo, Akwa&nbsp; Ibom, Lagos, Delta, Bauchi, Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abia, Oyo, Enugu, Ekiti, Nasarawa, Benue, Plateau, Edo, Anambra). The outbreak occurred primarily in southern parts of the country including Delta State. Public health measures included enhanced surveillance and health worker training, as well as isolation of cases, contact-tracing and quarantine. Since then, sporadic cases have continued to occur in Nigeria pointing to endemicity of the disease. In 2020, there were 14 suspected cases, three confirmed cases and no deaths. In 2021, a total of 32 suspected cases have been reported from January and May. Of the suspected cases, 7 were confirmed from five states Delta (2), Bayelsa (2), Lagos (1), Edo (1), Rivers (1) and no deaths were recorded.While a vaccine was approved for monkeypox in 2019, and traditional smallpox vaccine provides cross-protection for monkeypox, these vaccines are not widely available.

Previously, Australia and Egypt detected human infections with influenza A(H10N7), and China reported three human infections with avian influenza A(H10N8) in late 2013 and early 2014. Targeted surveillance projects have detected avian influenza A(H10N3) viruses in birds, however the extent of circulation and epidemiology of this virus in birds is unclear. Further genetic and antigenic characterization are ongoing to determine if this virus is different from previously detected avian influenza A(H10Nx) viruses. Most previously reported human infections with avian influenza viruses were due to exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments. Since avian influenza viruses, including A(H10Nx) viruses, continue to be detected in poultry populations, further sporadic human cases could be detected in the future. Currently available epidemiologic information suggests that avian influenza A(H10Nx) viruses have not acquired the ability of sustained human-to-human transmission, thus the likelihood of spread among humans is low. Should infected individuals from affected areas travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during travel or after arrival.

The disease manifestations are similar to human smallpox (eradicated since 1980), however human monkeypox is less severe. The disease is self-limiting with symptoms usually resolving within 14&ndash;21 days. Treatment is supportive. This is the first outbreak in Nigeria since 1978. The virus is transmitted through direct contact with blood, bodily fluids and cutaneous/mucosal lesions of an infected animals (rats, squirrels, monkeys, dormice, striped mice, chimpanzees amongst others rodents) Secondary human-to-human transmission is limited but can occur via exposure to respiratory droplets, contact with infected persons or contaminated materials.",
2017-DON6,22-december-2017-diphtheria-yemen-en,2017-DON6,Assessment,"Diphtheria is a vaccine-preventable disease caused by toxin- producing&nbsp;Corynebacterium diphtheriae, transmitted from person to person through close physical and respiratory contact. Respiratory diphtheria is fatal in 5&ndash;10% of cases, with a higher mortality rate in young children. Treatment involves administering diphtheria antitoxin as well as antibiotics. Vaccination against diphtheria has reduced global mortality and morbidity of diphtheria dramatically in recent decades.The occurrence of an outbreak of diphtheria indicates insufficient coverage of the national childhood immunization programmes, combined with waning immunity in previously vaccinated individuals. With ongoing transmission, there is risk for further spread of the disease to neighboring countries with low vaccination coverage.Epidemiological surveillance for early detection of diphtheria outbreaks should be strengthened in Yemen. All countries in the region should have access to laboratory testing for reliable identification of toxin-producing&nbsp;Corynebacterium diphtheriae. Adequate quantities of diphtheria antitoxins and antibiotics should be available nationally or regionally for the medical management of cases.The risk of further disease transmission is very high at the national level and high at the regional level because of several factors including ongoing armed conflict, an unprecedented cholera outbreak that has overwhelmed the health system, disrupted health services, limited healthcare workforce, lack of financial resources to run health facilities and to pay the salaries of health workers, and sub-optimal vaccination coverage. Additionally, there is a limited supply of diphtheria antitoxin at the global level and no reagents for laboratory confirmation at the country level. Medical supplies are in a chronic shortage despite extensive support from WHO and other health partners, further complicating the delivery of life-saving healthcare in the country.",
2017-DON2,22-december-2017-yellow-fever-nigeria-en,2017-DON2,Assessment,"Yellow fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic disease transmitted by mosquitoes and has the potential to spread rapidly and cause serious public health impact. There is no specific treatment, although the disease is preventable using a single dose of yellow fever vaccine, which provides immunity for life. Supportive care to treat dehydration, respiratory failure and fever, and antibiotic treatment for associated bacterial infections is recommended.Taking into consideration the reporting of suspected cases from 16 states and confirmed cases from six states, possible suboptimal immunisation coverage in affected communities, and in-country capacity to respond to sporadic cases and to conduct larger preventive campaigns (if warranted), WHO has assessed the overall risk at national level as high. There is currently a moderate risk of regional spread due to the proximity of affected states (Zamfara, and possibly Kebbi; approximately 400km from the border with Niger) and the low population immunity in this country (35.4%). The overall risk at the global level is low.The risk of the number of cases increasing depends in part on the density of vectors competent for sustained vector-borne transmission within human populations but no entomological information is currently available outside of Kwara. The region is entering the dry season and vector densities will be lower overall, but Aedes aegypti, which can amplify yellow fever outbreaks within human populations, is an anthropophilic vector which dwells in man-made containers around houses and is moderately affected by drier conditions.Nigeria is facing several concurrent public health emergencies, including cholera and Lassa fever outbreaks in other states, and a humanitarian crisis in the northeast of the country. The situation is being closely monitored.",

2015-DON8,12-january-2018-cholera-tanzania-en,2015-DON8,Assessment,"Active cholera transmission has persisted in Tanzania Mainland, with Mbeya and Songwe Regions being the most active. The country remains vulnerable to the late detection of cholera due to the weak surveillance systems. The WASH activities, case management, community engagement, and surveillance pillars still require strengthening for optimal outbreak response and, if not addressed, further upsurge of cases may be observed throughout the country. The risk at national level is therefore high.The closure of the fishing camps along Lake Rukwa on the Songwe Region border, forced the fishermen to move further south to Kyela district which borders Malawi&rsquo;s Karonga district. Malawi recently reported a cholera outbreak in Karonga. Cross-border population movement between the two countries might further increase the risk of transmission in Malawi. Other neighbouring countries such as DRC, Burundi, Zambia and Kenya are already experiencing large cholera outbreaks. The risk at regional level is high.",
2018-DON12,15-january-2018-hepatitis-e-namibia-en,2018-DON12,Assessment,"Although hepatitis A, B, and C are common in Namibia, hepatitis E is rarely diagnosed in the country. As a result, the country has limited capacity for hepatitis E laboratory diagnosis. Additionally, the majority of hepatitis E cases have been reported from informal settlements within the capital district, Windhoek, where living conditions are poor. These areas are overcrowded, and have limited access to safe drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene. Moreover, the holiday season will likely increase the movement of people within the country. All of these could be major contributing factors to this outbreak.Additionally, during the rainy season, people often use rainwater or other surface water for drinking and domestic uses. This likely increases the risk of hepatitis E infection. Therefore, the above-mentioned factors might lead to the propagation of the cases from this area to other informal settlements and its distribution to other towns or districts, with similar poor environmental health conditions. Thus, the overall risk is assessed as high at the national level and low at regional and global levels.",
2017-DON14,22-january-2018-yellow-fever-brazil-en,2017-DON14,Assessment,"The number of epizootics reported since July 2017 continues to be a concern, especially near urban areas of large cities, such as S&atilde;o Paulo, and in municipalities that were previously not considered at risk for yellow fever.While measures implemented by the Brazilian authorities during the 2016/2017 outbreak have contributed to the occurrence of a smaller number of cases when comparing the periods from 28 November 2016 through 15 January 2017 with 27 November 2017 through 14 January 2018. The large number of unvaccinated people who continue to live in areas with ecosystems favorable for transmission of the yellow fever virus represent a elevated risk for the change in the current transmission pattern.It is expected that the decision of the Brazilian authorities to carry out a mass vaccination campaign against yellow fever, including standard (0.5 ml) and fractional (0.1 ml) doses, can effectively limit the transmission of yellow fever. It is important to note that, due to its scale and scope, this mass vaccination campaign will likely be characterized by significant logistical challenges.",

2018-DON20,19-february-2018-cholera-mozambique-en,2018-DON20,Assessment,"Risk factors contributing to the propagation of cholera to other provinces and districts in this outbreak include a shortage of potable water and contamination of household drinking water, which emphasize the need to improve access to clean water, adequate hygiene, and sanitation. The three provinces which have reported cholera cases in this outbreak have been severely affected by the flooding which has resulted in the displacement of people and damage to the infrastructure, including health facilities. The meteorological forecast indicates that this heavy rainfall will continue for the next three months which may contribute to the potential spread of the outbreak.It is not possible to determine the magnitude of this outbreak, as no epidemiological or environmental investigations have been conducted in the two affected provinces and disease risk factors are unknown. Priorities at this stage are to strengthen the surveillance system, and harmonizing cholera data collection and line listing of the cases, as well as putting in place a mechanism for active case finding at the community level. In addition, the cholera case definition should be strictly applied to all suspected cases to decrease underreporting and to improve case detection in this outbreak. Other response activities such as case management, implementation of WASH interventions and social mobilization also need to be strengthened at the national, provincial, district and community levels.The overall risk is assessed as high at the national level; this assessment is partially due to the lack of information regarding the current outbreak dynamics and response actions. The risk is assessed to be low at the regional and global levels.",
2018-DON18,22-february-2018-lassa-fever-liberia-en,2018-DON18,Assessment,"Lassa fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic fever illness that is transmitted to humans via contact with food or household items contaminated with rodent urine or faeces. Person-to-person infections and laboratory transmission can also occur. Overall, the case fatality rate is approximately 1%; however, it can be 15% or more among patients hospitalized with severe symptoms. Early treatment and rehydration improves the chance of survival. Lassa fever causes outbreaks almost every year in different parts of Liberia and West Africa.The trend in the number of Lassa fever cases reported per week in Liberia has remained stable from January 2017 through 18 February 2018. Public health actions should be focused on preparedness in Liberia and areas of Guinea which border Nimba County. Active case finding, contact tracing, laboratory support and risk communication activities should continue. Although there is significant population movement between Liberian states and across the border of Nimba County with Guinea, neither large-scale disease transmission nor outbreaks in Guinea have been reported.",
2018-DON23,22-february-2018-ah7n4-china-en,2018-DON23,Assessment,"This is the first report of a human case of avian influenza A(H7N4) infection globally and the case reported exposure to live backyard poultry before illness onset. Genetic analysis of this influenza A(H7N4) virus indicates that it is of avian origin.Close contacts of the case-patient tested negative for avian influenza A(H7N4) and remained asymptomatic. Current evidence suggests that this virus does not have the ability of sustained transmission to humans, thus the likelihood of sustained human to human transmission is low. Any animal influenza virus that develops the ability of human to human transmission can theoretically cause a pandemic.It is possible that additional human cases of avian influenza A(H7N4) will be detected, however only one human case has been detected so far, and information on the circulation of avian influenza A(H7N4) in birds is not currently available. Further information needs to be gathered to increase the confidence in this assessment.",

The most recent human case reported in the Gambia occurred in 2002. Currently, there is no indication of a risk of a Rift Valley fever outbreak in Gambia, Senegal or Guinea-Bissau.Heavy rainfall, causing flooding and mass emergence of Rift Valley fever vectors is closely associated with Rift Valley fever outbreaks. Rift Valley fever can cause trade reductions and significant economic losses due to high mortality and abortion rates among infected ruminants. Integrated control measures that address both human and animal health are therefore necessary. These measures include educational campaigns for populations at risk.",
2018-DON21,27-february-2018-chikungunya-kenya-en,2018-DON21,Assessment,"Based on the available information, the risk of continued transmission in affected areas and spread to unaffected areas cannot be ruled out.Mombasa is the second largest city in Kenya with approximately 1.2 million inhabitants. The city has a rapidly growing population, and some areas experience overcrowding, numerous open dump sites, inadequate drainage, stagnant water and ample breeding sites for mosquitoes. These factors make Mombasa particularly vulnerable to vector-borne diseases. Mombasa County is also a popular tourist destination and a sub-regional transportation hub with connections to Rwanda, Tanzania and Ethiopia. This is the first time that active circulation of chikungunya has been laboratory confirmed in Mombasa. Further sequencing of the circulating virus is therefore needed to better assess the current epidemiologic situation.",
2018-DON25,27-february-2018-yellow-fever-brazil-en,2018-DON25,Assessment,"The rapid increase in human cases and epizootics during recent weeks is concerning due to the persistence of virus circulation in at-risk areas and the spread to new areas, particularly near urban areas of large cities, such as S&atilde;o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, and in municipalities that were previously not considered at-risk for yellow fever.To date, yellow fever transmission by&nbsp;Aedes aegypti&nbsp;has not been documented in Brazil. In entomological studies conducted during the 2016/2017 outbreak in some of the affected states, isolated&nbsp;Haemagogus&nbsp;mosquitoes were found to be positive for yellow fever indicating predominantly sylvatic transmission. More recently, an investigation conducted by the Evandro Chagas Institute reported by the Brazil Ministry of Health revealed the detection of yellow fever virus in&nbsp;Aedes albopictus&nbsp;mosquitoes captured in rural areas of two municipalities in Minas Gerais (Itu&ecirc;ta and Alvarenga) in 2017. The significance of this finding requires further investigation.The preliminary results of the mass vaccination campaign in S&atilde;o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro states indicate low vaccination coverage which suggests a significant number of persons remain at-risk and the necessity to intensify vaccination activities and risk communications among high-risk groups and hard-to-reach groups. The occurrence of two (possibly three) confirmed cases among unvaccinated travellers indicates the need for State Parties to reinforce the dissemination of recommendations for international travellers.",
2018-DON26,01-march-2018-lassa-fever-nigeria-en,2018-DON26,Assessment,"Lassa fever is a viral haemorrhagic fever that is transmitted to humans via contact with food or household items contaminated with rodent urine or faeces. Person-to-person infections and laboratory transmission can also occur. The overall case fatality rate is 1%; it is 15% among patients hospitalized with severe illness. Early supportive care with rehydration and symptomatic treatment improves survival. The antiviral drug ribavirin seems to be an effective treatment for Lassa fever if given early on in the course of clinical illness. There is no evidence to support the role of ribavirin as post-exposure prophylactic treatment for Lassa fever. Lassa fever is known to be endemic in Benin, Guinea, Ghana, Liberia, Mali, Sierra Leone, Togo and Nigeria, and most likely exists in other West African countries.The current Lassa fever outbreak in Nigeria shows an increasing trend in the number of cases and deaths in recent weeks with 317 confirmed cases reported in 2018 so far. This is the largest outbreak of Lassa fever ever reported in Nigeria.The infection of 14 health care workers that were not working in Lassa fever case management centers highlights the urgent need to strengthen infection prevention and control practices in all health care setting for all patients, regardless of their presumed diagnosis. Given the high number of states affected, the clinical management will likely happen in health centers that are not appropriately prepared to care for patients affected by Lassa fever and the risk of infection in health care workers will increase.The reporting of confirmed cases in different parts of the country and porous borders with neighbouring countries indicate a risk of spread nationally and to neighbouring countries. An overall moderate level of risk remains at the regional level. Public health actions should be focused on enhancing ongoing activities including surveillance, contact tracing, laboratory testing, and case management. Greater coordination and information sharing regarding Lassa fever cases and contacts with Benin would also contribute to rapid detection and response to cross-border spread of the outbreak.",

It is primarily linked to insufficient access to safe water and adequate sanitation. Cholera is a potentially serious infectious disease and can cause high morbidity and mortality. It has the potential to spread rapidly, depending on the frequency of exposure, the population exposed, and the context.Kinshasa is the third largest city in Africa with a population of approximately 10 million inhabitants. The city is characterized by a rapidly growing population driven by rural migration, leading to overcrowding and frequent occupation of flood plains that are not suitable for settlement, poor infrastructure, lack of adequate drainage and limited access to water and sanitation. These factors make Kinshasa particularly vulnerable to flooding and waterborne diseases, especially during the rainy season, which runs from November to June.Although the weekly incidence of cases in Kinshasa has been on a downward trend since mid-January 2018, the situation remains alarming. New cases have been reported in areas located along the Congo River which is a major trading and transport axis to and from Kinshasa. During week beginning 13 February 2018, the health zone of Maluku I in Kinshasa province reported cases for the first time since the beginning of this outbreak. Maluku I is a major port city and an endemic area for cholera in Kinshasa. However since a vaccination campaign was conducted in this area in October 2016, no cases had been reported until now. The emergence of cases in areas along the Congo River and the arrival of the second rainy season which will last from March to June pose a risk for the resurgence of cases in Kinshasa.This outbreak has started in 2015 and is considered as the worst cholera epidemic experienced by the country since 1994. In 2017, a total of 55 000 cases and 1190 deaths have been reported nationally. This is almost double the number of cases reported in 2016. Overall 24 out of 26 provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo have reported cases. The country is going through a long lasting economic and political crisis. Furthermore, the Democratic Republic of the Congo is also responding to a large humanitarian emergency (IASC level 3) with more than 4 000 000 internally displaced persons (IDPs) and 600 000 refugees. The country&rsquo;s resources and capacity to effectively respond to the current outbreak are limited.The risk of this outbreak spreading to neighbouring countries is considered high due to regular population movement and the risk at the global level was assessed to be low.",
2018-DON24,2018-DON23,2018-DON24,Assessment,The detection of this cVDPV2 strain underscores the importance of maintaining high levels of routine polio vaccination coverage at all levels to minimize the risk and consequences of any poliovirus circulation. Such event also underscores the risk in areas or regions with continued substantial insecurity that hampers maintaining high population immunity through routine vaccination. WHO will continue to evaluate the epidemiological situation and prevention measures being implemented.&nbsp;,
2018-DON27,09-march-2018-yellow-fever-brazil-en,2018-DON27,Assessment,"The exponential increase in human cases and epizootics during January and February 2018, as indicated in Figure 1, is concerning due to the persistence of high viral circulation in at-risk areas and the spread to new areas, particularly near urban areas of large cities, such as S&atilde;o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, and in municipalities that were previously not considered at-risk for Yellow fever.The preliminary results of the mass vaccination campaign in S&atilde;o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro states indicate low vaccination coverage which suggests a significant number of persons remain at-risk and the necessity to intensify risk communications among high-risk groups.Despite the significant efforts made to vaccinate large portion of the population, the increasing number of human cases and the persistence and geographical spread of epizootics among non-human primates illustrate the potential risk of further spread to new areas within Brazil that were not previously considered as at risk and where therefore yellow fever immunization coverage is low. The seasonality need also to be taken in to account as the outbreak is occurring the period of the year the most favourable for sylvatic yellow fever transmission.The increasing occurrence of confirmed yellow fever infection also shows the potential of international spread. Although to date most imported cases have been reported in countries where the vector is absent (or absent during winter). These reports illustrate the importance of maintaining high levels of awareness especially for international travellers from areas with favourable ecosystem for yellow fever transmission.To date, yellow fever transmission by&nbsp;Aedes aegypti&nbsp;has not been documented. The sylvatic yellow fever virus is transmitted to monkeys by forest dwelling mosquitoes such as&nbsp;Haemagogus&nbsp;and&nbsp;Sabethes spp.&nbsp;Humans who are exposed to these mosquitoes can become infected if they are not vaccinated. In entomological studies conducted during the 2016/2017 outbreak in some of the affected states, isolated&nbsp;Haemagogus&nbsp;mosquitoes were found to be positive for yellow fever indicating predominantly sylvatic transmission. More recently, an investigation conducted by the&nbsp;Evandro Chagas&nbsp;Institute reported by the Brazil Ministry of Health revealed the detection of yellow fever virus in&nbsp;Aedes albopictus&nbsp;mosquitoes captured in rural areas of two municipalities in Minas Gerais (Itu&ecirc;ta and Alvarenga) in 2017. The significance of this finding requires further investigation. The last documented outbreak of urban yellow fever in Brazil was recorded in 1942.WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and review the risk assessment based on the latest available information.",

The patient had relatively mild disease, did not require hospitalization and has fully recovered.It is important to note that this reassortant A(H1N2) of seasonal influenza viruses is different from the variant (v) influenza viruses found in human cases reported in the United States of America [ A(H1N1)v, A(H1N2)v, A(H3N2)v)] which comprise genes from swine influenza viruses (3).Currently, the Netherlands are facing an abnormally long season of seasonal influenza; it is the 14th week above the epidemic threshold. Over the last 20 years, the influenza season lasted on average nine weeks. Influenza B viruses of the Yamagata lineage have predominated this season but since March 2018, influenza subtypes A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) have been increasingly detected .WHO assesses the risk posed by this virus to be comparable to the risk posed by the currently circulating seasonal influenza viruses, as all the genes of this reassortant virus originate from circulating seasonal viruses. The hemagglutinin (HA) and nonstructural (NS) genes are very similar to the genes of the seasonal A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses circulating recently, and the remaining six genes are very similar to those of recently circulating A(H3N2) viruses. Further characterization of the seasonal reassortant A(H1N2) influenza virus is currently ongoing.",

Person-to-person infections and laboratory transmission can also occur when there is unprotected contact with blood or bodily fluids. Although the overall case fatality rate is 1% in all patients with Lassa fever (when asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic patients are included), mortality has been reported to be as high as 20% or higher among patients hospitalized with severe illness. Early supportive care with rehydration and ribavirin treatment improves survival. There is no evidence to support the role of ribavirin as post-exposure prophylactic treatment for Lassa fever, except for high-risk contacts. Lassa fever is known to be endemic in Benin, Guinea, Ghana, Liberia, Mali, Sierra Leone, Togo and Nigeria, and most likely exists in other West African countries.The current Lassa fever outbreak in Nigeria shows a decreasing trend in the number of cases and deaths in the most recent four weeks. This declining trend needs to be interpreted with caution as historical data shows that the high transmission period has not passed. The surveillance system has recently been strengthened. This is the largest outbreak of Lassa fever ever reported in Nigeria.The infection of 17 health care workers highlights the urgent need to strengthen infection prevention and control practices in all health care setting for all patients, regardless of their presumed diagnosis. Given the high number of states affected, triage and initial clinical management will likely happen in health centres that are not appropriately prepared to care for patients affected by Lassa fever and the risk of infection in health care workers will increase.The reporting of confirmed cases in different parts of the country and porous borders with neighbouring countries indicate a risk of spread nationally and to neighbouring countries. An overall moderate level of risk remains at the regional level. Public health actions should be focused on enhancing ongoing activities including surveillance, contact tracing, laboratory testing, and case management. Greater coordination and information sharing regarding Lassa fever cases and contacts with Benin would also contribute to rapid detection and response to cross-border spread of the outbreak.",

Due to the potentially long incubation period of listeriosis (one to three weeks and up to 70 days) further cases are expected before the impact of the food recall is observed.Following the identification of the source of this outbreak, WHO is now concerned that the export of implicated products may have resulted in listeriosis cases in other countries. Detailed information on the implicated product batches exported to each of the identified 15 countries should be shared with WHO and the International Food Safety Authorities Network (INFOSAN) Secretariat. This will help to facilitate efficient recalls of these products.Recently, Namibia reported a confirmed case of listeriosis. It is important that this case and other possible cases be properly investigated and the implicated food sources identified. The isolated&nbsp;Listeria&nbsp;strains should be sequenced to determine potential links to the outbreak in South Africa. Some of these countries may not have well-established surveillance systems and laboratory diagnostic services in place to detect cases of listeriosis. In such cases, WHO is ready to provide support and has reached out to 16 African nations (two West African countries and 14 members of SADC) to provide support for preparedness and response.An increase in public concern about the outbreak has been reflected in media reports and discussions in various social media platforms.",
2018-DON29,29-march-2018-cholera-somalia-en,2018-DON29,Assessment,"Cholera is an acute enteric infection caused by the ingestion of&nbsp;Vibrio cholerae&nbsp;bacteria. It is primarily linked to insufficient access to safe water and adequate sanitation. Cholera is a potentially serious infectious disease and can cause high morbidity and mortality. It has the potential to spread rapidly, depending on the frequency of exposure, the population exposed, and the context.Cholera is endemic in Somalia and continuous transmission was reported in the last few years. The last outbreak, which occurred in 2017, was one of the largest cholera epidemics the country has experienced: 78 000 cases, including 1159 deaths (case fatality ratio = 1.5%) were reported from 16 regions. The outbreak reached its peak in April 2017 and gradually declined from June until August 2017, and only few sporadic suspected cases were recorded between October and November 2017.Despite the control and prevention measures implemented during the last large cholera outbreak in 2017, the risk of the current outbreak is considered high at the national level because of the following:Only 16% of the at-risk population was vaccinated during last year&rsquo;s OCV campaign, which is too low to provide population-level immunity;There are large population movements in the affected areas due to drought, conflict and floods;The regions affected have the highest concentration of IDPs where access to safe water, hygiene and sanitation (WASH) is limited;Funding for cholera control and treatment measures will continue through to 2018, which include activities related to WASH and OCV campaigns. The lack of longer-term funding, however, remains a concern as the seasonal recurrence patterns require more predictable financing for more effective prevention and mitigation.At the regional and global levels, the level of risk was assessed by WHO to be low.WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conduct risk assessments based on the latest available information.",

NiV was first recognized in 1998-1999 during an outbreak among pig farmers in Malaysia and Singapore. No subsequent outbreaks have been reported in Malaysia or Singapore since 1999. NiV was first recognized in India and Bangladesh in 2001; since then, nearly annual outbreaks have occurred in Bangladesh. The disease has been identified periodically in eastern India (2001, 2007).Limited human-to-human transmission of NiV can occur among family members and health workers who treat infected patients. Large fruit bats of the genus Pteropus are the natural reservoirs of NiV and given the wide distribution of the species and migration of the locally-abundant fruit bats in India, the risk of exposure to NiV is high. Nevertheless, previous outbreaks in affected countries have had a strong seasonal pattern and a limited geographical range.Possible routes of transmission for this outbreak include consumption of fruits partially eaten by the bats, exposure to the virus by bats or human-to-human transmission through unprotected close contact in the community or hospital. Many cases identified in the current outbreak were infected through direct unprotected contact with other infected persons.Given that India has faced and contained Nipah virus outbreaks before, the country has the capacity to rapidly respond and verify cases with laboratory testing. At the moment, the outbreak is localized and WHO assesses the risk to be low at the national and regional levels.",

It was first detected in monkeys in Africa in 1958. The disease is caused by orthopoxvirus and has manifestations similar to human smallpox (eradicated since 1980), however human monkeypox is less severe. The disease is self-limiting with symptoms usually resolving within 14&ndash;21 days. Treatment is supportive. The virus is transmitted through direct contact with blood, bodily fluids and cutaneous/mucosal lesions of an infected person or animals, mainly African rodents or monkeys. Secondary human-to-human transmission is limited but can occur via exposure to, infectious oropharyngeal exudates and contact with infected persons during the rash phase of illness or contaminated materials. There are no specific treatments or vaccines available for monkeypox infection but outbreaks can be controlled.The detection of monkeypox in Cameroon underscores the need to maintain high level of vigilance and raise awareness of the disease among the local population. Communication and education for people on how to prevent infection by avoiding contact with wild animals particularly rodents and primates are important. Healthcare workers should follow standard precautions when taking care of symptomatic patients and isolate them. The cases are reported from rural areas where occupational activities such as farming and hunting are increasing the risk of animal-to-human transmission.WHO will continue to evaluate the epidemiological situation and support the implementation of prevention and response measures in collaboration with national governments and partners.",

Measles virus is transmitted via droplets from the nose, mouth, or throat of infected persons. Initial symptoms, which usually appear 10&ndash;12 days after infection, include high fever, usually accompanied by one of several of the following: runny nose, bloodshot eyes, cough and tiny white spots on the inside of the mouth. Several days later, a rash develops, starting on the face and upper neck and gradually spreading downwards.A patient is infectious four days before the start of the rash to four days after the appearance of the rash. There is no specific antiviral treatment for measles, and most people recover within two to three weeks. Case management includes vitamin A administration and antipyretics, and antibiotic and anti-diarrheal medications as needed. Among malnourished children and people with greater susceptibility, measles can cause serious complications, including blindness, encephalitis, severe diarrhea, ear infection, and pneumonia. Measles can be prevented by immunization. In countries with low vaccination coverage, epidemics typically occur every two to three years and usually last between two and three months, although their duration varies according to population size, crowding, and the population&rsquo;s immunity status.The Region of the Americas was declared free of measles in September 2016, nevertheless, outbreaks caused by imported cases from other regions may occur sporadically.The risk of spread at the national level in Brazil remains high due to the epidemiological situation and the high potential of transmission. The main challenges are vaccination coverage among immigrants and laboratory diagnostic capacity in local facilities. Because of ongoing transmission, vaccination strategies and other actions are being implemented to control the outbreak by local and federal authorities in Brazil. At the regional level, the potential impact is considered high given the performance of routine immunization programmes and prevention and control capacities in other countries in the Region.",

2018-DON76,05-september-2018-ah7n9-china-en,2018-DON76,Assessment,"Although reporting of virus detection has declined in poultry and the environment, as long as the virus still circulates, even at low levels, further human cases can be expected. Currently available epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that this virus has not acquired the ability of sustained transmission among humans, thus the likelihood of human-to-human transmission of the A(H7N9) virus is low.",
2018-DON75,7-september-2018-yellow-fever-congo-en,2018-DON75,Assessment,"The overall public health risk at the national level is high due to the confirmation of a yellow fever case in a densely populated urban city of Pointe-Noire (&lrm;1.2 million inhabitants), with suboptimal immunization coverage in the affected community and the potential risk of spread within the Congo, especially to the capital city of Brazzaville. Entomological surveys in the affected area revealed high densities of Aedes aegypti, responsible for urban transmission of yellow fever, signalling the potential for rapid amplification. The approaching rainy season may potentially increase this risk. Thus, the risk of an urban epidemic needs to be mitigated urgently, although there is no indication of active urban transmission according to the information available.The risk at the regional level is considered to be moderate due to the lack of information to describe the scope and the dynamics of the outbreak, as well as because of cross-border movements, particularly between to and from Gabon and Cabinda in Angola. Pointe-Noire is a port city and oil industry hub with an international airport and links to other large cities. Angola and the Democratic Republic of the Congo have recently conducted mass preventive and reactive yellow fever vaccination campaigns, respectively. However, population immunity levels in the Democratic Republic of the Congo are low in the zones not targeted by the 2016 reactive campaigns, such as the areas neighbouring Pointe-Noire. No other yellow fever cases related to the outbreak in Pointe-Noire have been reported outside the country at this stage.The risk at the global level is considered low. Risks need to be closely monitored and regularly reassessed.",
2018-DON79,12-september-2018-mers-republic-of-korea-en,2018-DON79,Assessment,"The virus does not pass easily from person to person unless there is close contact, such as providing unprotected care to an infected patient. Infection with MERS-CoV can cause severe disease resulting in high rates of morbidity and mortality. Community-acquired human infections with MERS-CoV have occurred from direct or indirect contact with infected dromedary camels. MERS-CoV can also transmit between humans, through unprotected contact with an infected person. So far, the observed non-sustained human-to-human transmission has occurred mainly in health care settings. Human-to-human transmission can be stopped with adequate infection prevention and control measures.The notification of a confirmed case in the Republic of Korea does not change WHO&rsquo;s overall global risk assessment for MERS. As a result of comprehensive contact tracing and testing of high risk contacts, additional cases may be identified in relation to this one case. Additional infections identified as part of the ongoing public health response will not change the overall global public health risk, which is low.WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East and that sporadic cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who have acquired the infection after exposure to infected animals, animal products or human cases (for example, in a health care setting). To date, no cases have been associated with Hajj.WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conduct risk assessments based on the latest available information.",
2018-DON78,14-september-2018-cholera-algeria-en,2018-DON78,Assessment,"Cholera is an acute enteric infection caused by the ingestion of water or food contaminated with&nbsp;V. cholerae&nbsp;bacteria. Cholera is a potentially serious infectious disease and can cause high rates of morbidity and mortality. It has the potential to spread rapidly, depending on the frequency of exposure, the population exposed, and the context.The last confirmed case of&nbsp;V. cholerae&nbsp;infection in Algeria was reported in 1996. The current outbreak developed rapidly with 41 confirmed cases reported between 7 and 23 August, and an average of four cases reported daily from 24 to 30 August. The source of the outbreak and transmission vehicle is currently not known but the MoH and Institut Pasteur Algeria reported that most of the cases were clustered within a family group.Cases have been reported in an urban setting where there is an increased risk of transmission, especially as the source of the outbreak has not been identified and therefore the source may still persist as a risk in the community. However, the most recent information published by the MoH suggests that the outbreak is receding.",
2018-DON80,20-september-2018-cholera-zimbabwe-en,2018-DON80,Assessment,"The outbreak started on 5 September and the number of cases notified per day continues to rapidly increase, particularly in Glen View and Budiriro suburbs of Harare. Cases with epidemiological links to this outbreak have been reported from other provinces across the country. Glen View, which is the epicentre of the outbreak, is an active informal trading area where people come from across the city and the rest of the country to trade. Key risk factors for cholera in Zimbabwe include the deterioration of sanitary and health infrastructure and increasing rural-urban migration which further strains the water and sanitation infrastructure. In Harare, contaminated water from boreholes and wells is suspected to be the source of the outbreak. The water supply situation in Harare remains dire due to the high demand of water that is not being met by the city supply. The country&rsquo;s available response capacities are overstretched as authorities are already responding to a large typhoid outbreak which started in August 2018. WHO assessed the overall public health risk to be high at the national level and moderate at the regional and low at global levels.",

2018-DON93,05-october-2018-monkeypox-nigeria-en,2018-DON93,Assessment,"Monkeypox is a sylvatic zoonosis with incidental human infections that occur sporadically in the rain forests of Central and West Africa. It is caused by the MPXV and belongs to the Orthopoxvirus family, the same group of viruses as smallpox.Two distinct MPXV clades exist; the Congo Basin and West African. There are differences in human pathogenicity between these two clades in clinical presentation and epidemiological characteristics. The animal reservoir remains unknown, however, evidence suggests that native African rodents may be potential sources. Direct contact with affected live and dead animals through hunting and consumption of bush meat are presumed drivers of human infection. The disease is self-limiting with symptoms usually resolving spontaneously within 14&ndash;21 days. Severe cases occur more commonly among children and are related to the extent of virus exposure, patient health status and severity of complications. The case fatality rate has varied widely between epidemics but has been between 1&ndash;10% in documented events. There is no specific treatment or vaccine for the MPXV infection.",
2018-DON87,05-october-2018-cholera-niger-en,2018-DON87,Assessment,"The current outbreak started in Madarounfa district in Maradi Region, one of the known hotspots for cholera along the Niger &ndash; Nigeria border, and has since spread to three geographically dispersed regions, including some of the most affected districts during previous cholera outbreaks. These areas are classified as high-risk areas for the spread of cholera given the presence of local risk factors such as poor hygiene and sanitary conditions coupled with significant population movement and trade between these districts and neighbouring areas in Nigeria. With the ongoing rainy season and the increase in cases in neighbouring Katsina State in Nigeria, the potential for further spread of the disease both within Niger and across the border with Nigeria is high. The population in the capital city Niamey as well as neighbouring Benin are at risk of being affected given the confirmation of cases in the Dosso Region which is a major trading hub on the border with Benin but also links the capital city Niamey. The bridge connecting Niger to Benin across the Niger River close to Gaya town has collapsed on 5 September, which may slow down population movement across this particular border but also forces the population to travel longer distances (possibly through Burkina Faso and Nigeria) to maintain economic and personal links with the other countries in the region.The recent upsurge of cholera cases in Borno State in Nigeria also puts the population in Niger&rsquo;s Diffa Region at risk given porous borders and mass movement in this area.The last major cholera outbreak reported in Niger occurred in 2014 and involved more than 2000 cases.",
2018-DON91,15-october-2018-chikungunya-sudan-en,2018-DON91,Assessment,"The overall risk of chikungunya at the national level is very high because of the following: presence of&nbsp;Aedes aegypti&nbsp;in most parts of the country, availability of breeding sites in houses and uncoordinated community involvement in vector control aggravated by the ongoing rainy season which favours the proliferation of the vector and spread of the outbreak to other states in the country. Also, in the absence of a good surveillance system to clearly define the dynamics of the outbreak, it is a big challenge to target the public health actions to control the outbreak. The lack of financial and technical resources to respond to needs, if not addressed immediately and properly, may lead to further escalation of the number of cases and eventually overwhelm the already over-stretched capacities of the country. The risk at the regional level is considered moderate. WHO Regional Office is already mobilizing its resources to support the ongoing outbreak and is prepared to support other neighbouring countries if the outbreak spreads outside Sudan. The overall risk at the global level is low.",

2018-DON105,18-December-2018-yellowfever-netherlands-en,2018-DON105,Assessment,"Yellow fever is an acute viral illness that has the potential to spread rapidly and cause a serious public health impact in an unimmunized population. Vaccination is the most effective means of preventing the infection.The importation of a case of yellow fever from Gambia or Senegal to the Netherlands represents international disease spread. However, sporadic imported cases of yellow fever from endemic countries in unvaccinated travellers are not unexpected. The risk of further local transmission of yellow fever virus related to this case in the Netherlands or further within the WHO European Region is currently considered to be negligible, as no competent vector for yellow fever has been established in the Netherlands. Both Senegal and Gambia have sustained high levels of population immunity against yellow fever, which should prevent major amplification of disease transmission in humans locally. However, the high coverage in the endemic population will not offer protection to unimmunized individuals in high risk areas because yellow fever can be spread from the infected non-human primate reservoir to unimmunized persons through mosquito bites (vector-borne transmission). Therefore, travel to endemic areas remains a significant risk for unvaccinated individuals.",
2018-DON106,27-december-2018-typhoid-pakistan-en,2018-DON106,Assessment,"The risk of XDR&nbsp;S.&nbsp;Typhi at the national level is considered high in Pakistan due to insufficient water, poor sanitation and hygiene (WASH) practices, low vaccination coverage and limited surveillance for typhoid fever. The fact that AMR&nbsp;S.&nbsp;Typhi confirmatory testing and antimicrobial susceptibility testing is only conducted by major laboratories and tertiary care hospitals are other priority considerations in terms of risk. These factors, coupled with sub-optimal antibiotic prescribing practices, have limited the ability to track the occurrence, spread, and containment of XDR&nbsp;S.&nbsp;Typhi.Outbreaks of MDR typhoid and sporadic cases of infection with ceftriaxone-resistant&nbsp;S.&nbsp;Typhi have been reported in several countries. However, this is the first time a large outbreak caused by XDR&nbsp;S.&nbsp;Typhi has been observed in Pakistan.The risk at regional level is considered moderate due to the similar environments and approaches to treatment of typhoid fever, as well as the widespread over-use of anti-microbials which is compounded by considerable levels of migration within the region.Globally, the risk is considered low due to the availability of antimicrobials and rational prescribing practices. However,&nbsp;S.&nbsp;Typhi has a global distribution and the potential for travelers to spread this resistant clone, especially in countries with poor WASH infrastructure, cannot be eliminated. The high level of resistance to traditional first-line antibiotics in the H58 clonal strain identified to be circulating in parts of Pakistan increases the potential risk at all three levels.",

2021-DON325,2021-DON325,2021-DON325,Assessment,"On 3 May 2021, the Ministry of Health of the Democratic Republic of the Congo declared the end of human-to-human transmission of EVD over in North Kivu Province considering that more than 42 days (two maximum incubation periods) had elapsed since the date of the second consecutive negative test of the last confirmed case. The World Health Organization assess that the surveillance system in place has proven its capacity to detect cases. The Ministry of Health drafted a 90-day plan which includes the strengthening and consolidation of public health surveillance systems. WHO notes &nbsp;that there remains a risk of re-emergence of EVD.&nbsp; Ebola virus is enzootic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and it can persist in some body fluids of survivors for several months which, in rare events, may result in secondary transmission. In addition, it is not unusual for sporadic cases to occur following a major&nbsp;outbreak. Re-emergence of EVD is a major public health issue in the DRC and there are still gaps in the country&rsquo;s capacity to prepare for and respond to outbreaks. A confluence of environmental and socioeconomic factors such as poverty, community mistrust, weak health systems, and political instability is accelerating the rate of the emergence of EVD in the DRC.Other health emergencies such as coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), cholera and measles outbreaks may jeopardize the country&rsquo;s ability to rapidly detect and respond to re-emergence of EVD cases.Since 10 March 2020, when the first confirmed COVID-19 case was registered in DRC a total of 29 962 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 766 deaths have been reported nationwide as of 1st May 2021.",

2021-DON315,circulating-vaccine-derived-poliovirus-type-2-global-update,2021-DON315,Assessment,"African Region: WHO considers there to be very high risk of international spread and/or emergence of cVDPV2 due to the low population immunity against poliovirus type 2 (PV2) and low IPV vaccination coverage. This in conjunction with the existence of known viruses that have persisted for over one year, large-scale population movements, and ongoing challenges for country&rsquo;s public health systems due to the COVID-19 epidemic and other infectious disease outbreaks in the Region.Eastern Mediterranean Region: WHO considers there to be a high risk of international spread and/or emergence of cVDPV2, based on existence of known polioviruses that have persisted in the population/environment for over one year, large inaccessible populations in some countries, where large pockets of low population immunity arise as a result.European Region: WHO considers there to be a low to moderate risk of international spread and/or emergence of cVDPV2 in the Region.Western Pacific Region: WHO considers there to be a low to moderate risk of international spread and/or emergence of cVDPV2.In all instances, the continued spread of existing outbreaks as well as the emergence of new outbreaks of cVDPV2 point to gaps in routine immunization coverage in addition to insufficient reactive vaccination as an outbreak response, with monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2). The risk of further spread of such strains, or the emergence of new strains in 2021 is magnified by an increasing gap in global mucosal-immunity to type 2 poliovirus and dropping immunization rates related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.In its report from its most recent meeting in February 2021, the Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations (2005) on the international spread of poliovirus expressed concern at the continued rapid spread of cVDPV2, and noted that the risk of international spread of cVDPV2 is currently very high and urged the implementation of advice aimed at reducing this risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;",

2020-DON273,2020-DON273,2020-DON273,Assessment,"Dracunculiasis, one of the Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs), is caused by the parasite Dracunculus medinensis (nematode-roundworm).It is transmitted usually by drinking water containing water fleas-also called copepods (small crustaceans) which are infected with larvae of&nbsp;D. medinensis. Eating uncooked fish or other aquatic animals bearing the guinea worm infected larvae is another plausible route of transmission. Following ingestion, the larvae migrate through the intestinal wall into body tissues, where they develop into adult worms and slowly migrate in the subcutaneous tissues toward the skin surface, causing painful blisters that rupture when it comes in contact with water, allowing the female worm to emerge and release larvae.The larvae are ingested by the copepods and after two weeks, these larvae metamorphose in the body cavities of the copepods and become infective. From the time infection occurs, it takes between 10&ndash;14 months for the transmission cycle to complete until a mature worm emerges from the body.Symptoms of guinea worm disease can include the following: Dizziness, a mild fever, uncomfortable rash, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.While the death rate is low, disability is a common outcome of guinea worm disease: infected people become non-functional for weeks or months. People have difficulty moving around because of the pain and complications caused by secondary bacterial infections. The disability that occurs during worm removal and recovery prevents people from working in their fields, tending animals, going to school, and caring for their families; hence, creating an economic and social burden for affected communities along with a vicious circle of poverty.It affects people in rural, deprived and isolated communities who depend mainly on open surface water sources such as ponds for drinking water. Guinea worm disease occurs in the poorest 10% of the world&rsquo;s population who have no access to safe drinking water or health care. People who live in villages where there has been a case of guinea worm disease in a human or animal in the recent past are at greatest risk.While Guinea worm transmission is limited to only two districts (Gog and Abobo of Gambella region) in Ethiopia, the presence of hard to reach communities and lack of safe water sources in remote non-village areas, a large refugee influx, and animal infections with an unknown role in transmission of dracunculiasis, remain significant challenges for guinea worm disease elimination in Ethiopia.In Ethiopia, only the region of Gambella remains endemic for the disease. Current human cases are reported from Gog district in this region. In Gog and Abobo districts of the Gambella region, a low-level transmission of guinea worm among dogs and peri-domestic baboons is being reported. Hence, communities living in the area are at higher risk of contracting the disease.The potential for the international spread is low. However, as a result of the regular cross-border population movement between Ethiopia and South Sudan, due to insecurity in South Sudan and activities of nomadic pastoralists, the risk of spreading Guinea worm disease between the two countries always remains high.Within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, health systems are strained worldwide due to the rapidly increasing demand of services for the management of this disease and other existing ones. Support from The Carter Center and WHO has reinforced active surveillance in all the communities of Gog and Abobo districts including those living in cross-border areas, particularly in and around refugee camps, to prevent any spread of the disease to South Sudan.",
2020-DON279,2020-DON279,2020-DON279,Assessment,"The detection of the yellow fever case in Savanes region shows that even in the context of relatively high population immunity there is a possibility of sylvatic yellow fever in unvaccinated people in rural areas. This highlights the importance of maintaining high population immunity in all high-risk areas for yellow fever. Recent entomological studies have indicated the presence of competent vectors, including the Aedes species, and the potential for spread to surrounding regions.The onset of the rainy season could increase the density of mosquito vectors, further exacerbating the risk of spread.While mass immunization took place in Togo in 2007, the country is considered to be high risk for endemic transmission. Unvaccinated people remain vulnerable to yellow fever infection, particularly in rural areas.Due to current COVID-19 pandemic, there is a risk of disruption to routine immunization activities due to both COVID-19 related burdens on the health system and a decreased demand for vaccination because of physical distancing requirements or community reluctance.

2020-DON282,2020-DON282,2020-DON282,Assessment,"Yellow fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic disease that has the potential to spread rapidly and cause serious public health impact in unvaccinated populations.The detection of the confirmed case of yellow fever in Nyanga Province shows the possibility of spill-over of sylvatic yellow fever in endemic areas to unvaccinated people in a rural area even in the context of moderately high population immunity (70%). This highlights the importance of achieving and maintaining high population immunity in all high-risk areas for yellow fever.There is currently a risk of disruption to routine immunization activities due to COVID-19 related impacts on the health system and a decreased demand for immunization due to physical distancing requirements or community reluctance. Disruption of immunization services, even for brief periods, will increase the numbers of susceptible people and the likelihood of outbreaks of vaccine preventable diseases.

2020-DON300,2020-DON300,2020-DON300,Assessment,"Although hepatitis A, B, and C are common in Burkina Faso, this is the first-time hepatitis E has been reported in the country. The national HIV/hepatitis reference laboratory at the Muraz Center in Bobo Dioulasso has an efficient technical platform capable of diagnosing hepatitis E but lacks reagents and rapid diagnostic kits. Efforts to improve case management and strengthen surveillance are ongoing. Additionally, the majority of hepatitis E cases have been reported within Barsalogho health district, which houses many internally displaced persons (IDPs) experiencing difficult living conditions. Aside from overcrowding, the main contributing factors leading to this outbreak could be limited access to clean water and poor sanitation and hygiene in the affected areas.The level of risk at the national level is considered moderate: given that this is a hepatitis E epidemic, occurring in a geographical area where the population has little access to essential water, and sanitation and hygiene services, requiring the implementation of effective and rapid prevention measures. Since January 2019, the North-Central region has been regularly subject to attacks by unidentified armed men (HANI), resulting in a dysfunction in the provision of care and the massive displacement of populations. The spread of this epidemic to other neighbouring health districts is possible if additional support measures are not put in place. The limited capacity of local actors to effectively support the response actions also constitute a risk of spreading this epidemic to other sub-prefectures or neighbouring health districts.The risk at the regional and global level remains low.",
2020-DON284,2020-DON284,2020-DON284,Assessment,"The latest WHO assessment concluded that the current EVD outbreak has been contained, considering that more than 42 days (two incubation periods) have elapsed since the date of the second consecutive negative test of the last case confirmed case on 13 May 2020. On 26 June 2020, WHO maintained the risk assessment for this event as Moderate at the national and regional levels, and the risk level remained Low at the global level.Under the Consolidation and Stabilization Strategic Plan adopted by the Ministry of Health, enhanced surveillance, a long-term programme for Ebola survivor care, and other response mechanisms remain in place following the end of the outbreak declaration to maintain increased vigilance and contribute to strengthening and resilience of the local health systems.Given that EVD is likely to persist in an animal reservoir in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, a new zoonotic spillover event may occur. Moreover, an EVD cluster may also occur from exposure to body fluids of survivors, although the probability of this will reduce over time.WHO considers ongoing challenges in access and security, community trust in authorities, fragile health systems, coupled with the emergence of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), cholera, measles and the EVD outbreak recently reported in &Eacute;quateur Province, as factors that might jeopardize the country&rsquo;s ability to rapidly detect and respond to the re-emergence of EVD cases in North Kivu, Ituri and South Kivu Provinces.As per the advice of the International Health Regulations (2005) Emergency Committee, which was convened on 26 June 2020, the WHO Director-General declared that the EVD outbreak in North Kivu, Ituri and South Kivu Provinces no longer constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.

2020-DON299,2020-DON299,2020-DON299,Assessment,"Nigeria is a high-risk country for yellow fever. The re-emergence of yellow fever in September 2017 in Nigeria has been marked by outbreaks over a wide geographical area. The yellow fever outbreaks reported in Bauchi, Benue and Katsina states from August to November 2019, with spread to multiple other states showed an expansion of YF transmission, and an elevated risk for YF outbreaks to rapidly spread and amplify, impacting areas without prior reported cases since 2017 and in areas with large under immunized populations. In the current year, suspected YF cases have been reported from all 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) and confirmed YF cases across 9 states (Delta, Enugu, Bauchi, Benue, Kogi, Oyo, Edo Kwara and Katsina). These new outbreaks in Bauchi, Delta and Enugu are affecting areas without prior reported cases this year and suggest underlying sustained high viral transmission in the epizootic cycle with spillover to human populations. Due to: the risk of spread to other states with under-immunized populations, including to large urban centers; the high CFR; the potential for ongoing local transmission and amplification due to suboptimal vaccination coverage; and the occurrence of cases in peri-urban areas (e.g. in Delta State) and densely populated LGAs with proximity to Lagos, the risk is high.There is no entomological information currently available for the affected LGAs, however previous entomological surveys conducted in 2018/2019 during outbreaks in settings of similar climate and vegetation in Ebonyi, Bauchi, Edo, Kogi and Kwara identified adult&nbsp;Aedes&nbsp;spp. mosquitos However, the region is entering the dry season (November to March) and vector densities are expected to be lower. The vector,&nbsp;Aedes aegypti&nbsp;is only moderately affected by drier conditions and remains active, and therefore sustained vector-borne transmission within human populations cannot be ruled out.Nigeria is facing several concurrent public health emergencies, including circulating Vaccine Derived Polio Virus (cVDPV), measles, monkeypox, Lassa fever and cholera outbreaks as well as humanitarian crisis in the northeast of the country. WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and review the risk assessment based on the latest available information. At present, the Yellow Fever outbreaks are considered high risk at national level, low at regional and global levels.",
2020-DON285,2020-DON285,2020-DON285,Assessment,"Infection with MERS-CoV can cause severe disease resulting in high mortality. Humans are infected with MERS-CoV from direct or indirect contact with dromedaries. MERS-CoV has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans. So far, the observed non-sustained human-to-human transmission has occurred mainly in health care settings.The notification of additional cases does not change the overall risk assessment. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who might acquire the infection after exposure to dromedaries, animal products (for example, consumption of camel&rsquo;s raw milk), or humans (for example, in a health care setting). WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information.Since 2012 until 31 May 2020, the total number of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection cases reported globally to WHO is 2 562 with 881 associated deaths. The global number reflects the total number of laboratory-confirmed cases reported to WHO under IHR to date. The total number of deaths includes the deaths that WHO is aware of to date through follow-up with affected member states.",
2020-DON291,chikungunya-chad,2020-DON291,Assessment,"Chikungunya is an arboviral disease transmitted to humans by the bites of infected&nbsp;Aedes&nbsp;mosquitoes. The disease is characterized by an abrupt onset of fever frequently accompanied by joint pain and inflammation which is often very debilitating and may last for several months, or even years. Fatalities associated with infection can occur but are typically rare and most reported in older adults with underlying medical conditions or perinatally-infected infants. Some patients might have a relapse of rheumatologic symptoms (e.g. polyarthralgia, polyarthritis, and tenosynovitis) in the months following acute illness.There is no specific antiviral treatment or commercially available vaccine for chikungunya. Chikungunya virus can cause large outbreaks with high attack rates, affecting one-third to three-quarters of the population in areas where the virus is circulating, and therefore potentially leading to the overburdening of the health care sector. The risk at national level is moderate due to the high number of cases reported in a short period of time, the presence of&nbsp;Aedes&nbsp;vectors in the country, and the fact that this is the first outbreak in the country. It has been demonstrated in the past in other parts of the world that the virus has a strong epidemic potential in the regions where the population is naive to chikungunya virus. As the dry season is approaching in early October with a hot semi-arid climate less favourable for mosquito proliferation, the risk at regional and global levels is lower. With the added burden of the COVID-19 pandemic on the health system and health workers, there is a risk of disruption to health care access. There may also be decreased demand because of physical distancing requirements or community reluctance. In the current context, the capacity of the local laboratories and national reference laboratories to process samples (due to the high demand in processing COVID-19 samples) and a further increase in the number of cases likely to occur, this could potentially lead to a significant strain on health services. In Chad, from 19 March through 16 September 2020, there have been 1 090 confirmed cases of COVID-19 with 81 deaths.",
2020-DON292,monkeypox-democratic-republic-of-the-congo,2020-DON292,Assessment,"Monkeypox is a sylvatic zoonosis with incidental human infections that occur sporadically in the rain forests of Central and West Africa. It is caused by the monkeypox virus (MPXV) which belongs to the Orthopoxvirus family, the same group of viruses as smallpox.There are two distinct clades of monkeypox virus, the Congo Basin clade and the West African clade. Monkeypox due to the Congo Basin clade virus has seen reported mortality of up to 10% of cases, whereas the West African clade usually displays fatal outcomes in less than 1% of cases. HIV infection appears to increase the risk of death in people infected with monkeypox virus.The animal reservoir remains unknown. However, evidence suggests that native African rodents may be potential sources. Contact with live and dead animals through hunting and bush meat are presumed drivers of human infection. The disease is self-limiting with symptoms usually resolving within 14-21 days. Severe cases occur more commonly among children and immunocompromised population, particularly persons with HIV, and are related to the extent of virus exposure, patient health status and severity of complications. The case fatality ratio has varied between epidemics but has been between 1% and 10% in documented events. There is no specific treatment licensed for monkeypox and a recently approved vaccine is not yet widely available for the public sector.Since identification of the first human case of monkeypox in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (then known as Zaire) in a 9-month-old boy, and until the year 1986, 95% of cases worldwide were reported in the DRC. Cases of monkeypox have also been reported from other African countries - Benin, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Gabon, C&ocirc;te d&rsquo;Ivoire, Liberia, Nigeria, the Republic of the Congo, Sierra Leone, and South Sudan. In 2003, an outbreak occurred in the United States of America following the importation of infected animals. Single imported cases were identified in Israel and the United Kingdom in 2018, and in Singapore in 2019, all following diagnosis in travelers from Nigeria. In the UK, a secondary case was confirmed in a health worker.With the eradication of smallpox and the subsequent cessation of routine smallpox vaccination, human monkeypox has appeared with increasing frequency in unvaccinated populations.The risk is assessed as high at national level, moderate at regional level, and low at global level.",
2020-DON293,oropouche-virus-disease---french-guiana-france,2020-DON293,Assessment,"This is the first detection of Oropouche virus in French Guiana. Therefore, the population is highly susceptible. To date, there is no evidence of direct human-to-human Oropouche virus transmission. Cases of infection with Oropouche virus have been reported in other countries within the Region of the Americas, and therefore the competent vector, the&nbsp;Culicoides paraensis&nbsp;midge is present in the region, as is&nbsp;Culex quinquefasciatus&nbsp;which can also be a vector. However, the extent to which these vectors are present in French Guiana needs to be further established. Given the geographical distribution of the other competent vectors in the Region of the Americas, cases may be identified in other countries. The WHO Regional Office for the Americas and the Pan-American Health Organization continue to monitor the epidemiological situation based on the latest available information.With the current COVID-19 pandemic, there is a risk of disruption to health care access due to both COVID-19 related burden on the health system and health care workers and decreased demand because of physical distancing requirements or community reluctance.Another aspect to consider given the current COVID-19 pandemic, is the capacity of the local laboratories and national reference laboratories to process samples for arboviruses due the over demand in processing COVID-19 samples and the absence of commercial diagnostic kits. As of 12 October, French Guiana reports 10 144 cases of COVID-19 and 69 deaths.",
2020-DON294,mayaro-virus-disease---french-guiana-france,2020-DON294,Assessment,"MAYV was isolated for the first time in Trinidad and Tobago in 1954. However, a retrospective study showed evidence of infection by MAYV in sera collected during the construction of channels in Panama and Colombia between 1904 and 1914. Since then, cases have been reported in Central America and South America, particularly in the regions around the Amazon basin with some cases exported by travelers reported in the academic literature. These cases impacted individuals from Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and unidentified parts of North America.Although some studies suggest MAYV transmission in urban areas, most of the outbreaks described in the last decade in the Americas were reported among residents of rural communities in the Amazon region of Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, and Venezuela. Most human cases occurred among persons who work or reside in tropical rainforests. The reservoir for MAYV is unknown, but some studies have reported virus isolation or high levels of antibodies in host vertebrates, such as non-human primates.Changes in the natural environment, deforestation, urbanization, and mining result in increased interactions between host and vector populations and demonstrates the potential of MAYV to emerge in new areas and re-emerge in existing areas.Mayaro fever is a mosquito borne zoonosis caused by Mayaro virus (MAYV), an arbovirus of the Alphavirus genus, Togavirus family. MAYV transmission is mainly maintained through the sylvatic cycle that involves non-human primates and&nbsp;Haemagogus&nbsp;mosquitoes. Human cases are associated with recent exposures to humid forest environments inhabited by these vectors.At the initial stage, Mayaro fever presents as a non-specific clinical picture like other arboviral diseases (dengue, chikungunya, Zika). The incubation period ranges between 1 to 12 days. The disease is self-limiting, with a duration from 3 to 5 days, with persistence of arthralgia that can remain for weeks or months; however as with others Alphavirus infections, MAYV can produce severe complications, such as intermittent fever, neurological complications, myocarditis, and even death.Due to the generic nature of the symptoms of arboviruses, misdiagnosis can occur. Cases of MAYV may be going undetected due to a lack of awareness among the medical community.Diagnostic testing for MAYV is not widely available, and little is known of MAYV outside of endemic areas. Imported cases may be getting clinically misdiagnosed as dengue, Zika, Chikungunya. In endemic regions coinfection with other arboviral diseases may also misguide the diagnosis of MAYV.The risk of international spread appears to be small at this stage but cannot be excluded if an urban transmission cycle is shown to have been established.In the urban coastal area around Cayenne, there is a risk of additional cases if the transmission occurred in the peri-urban forest. The most likely places of infection are still under investigation.The risk of spread at national level cannot be excluded as the virus circulates over a larger area, beyond Cayenne and its surroundings. Investigations are currently ongoing to determine the affected areas.With the global circulation of the current COVID-19 pandemic, there is a risk of disruption to healthcare access due to both COVID-19 related burden on the health system and healthcare workers, and decreased demand because of physical distancing requirements or community reluctance. Another aspect to be taken into consideration in the light of the current COVID-19 pandemic is the capacity of the local laboratories and national reference laboratories to process samples due the over-demand in processing COVID-19 samples, in addition to the ongoing epidemic of dengue and localized outbreak of Oropouche virus (for more information, please see the&nbsp;DON published on 13 October). Furthermore, due to non-availability of commercial diagnostic kits, Mayaro diagnostic capacity solely rests on the national reference laboratory. As of 18 October 2020, French Guiana has reported 10 268 COVID-19 cases and 69 deaths.",

2020-DON296,avian-influenza-a(h5n1)--lao-people-s-democratic-republic,2020-DON296,Assessment,"To date, 862 human cases of influenza A(H5N1) have been reported to WHO since 2003, including three from Lao PDR. Nearly all cases of avian influenza A(H5N1) infection in humans have been associated with close contact with infected live or dead birds, or influenza A(H5N1) virus-contaminated environments. Human infection can cause severe disease and has reportedly high mortality rate. Since the virus continues to be detected in poultry populations, further human cases can be expected.Currently available epidemiologic and virologic evidence suggests that A(H5N1) viruses have not acquired the ability of sustained transmission among humans, thus the likelihood of human-to-human spread is low. Should infected individuals from affected areas travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during travel or after arrival. If this were to occur, further community level spread is considered unlikely as this virus has not acquired the ability to transmit easily among humans.This case does not change the current WHO recommendations on public health measures and surveillance of influenza. Thorough investigation of every human infection with a un-subtypeable influenza A virus is essential.",
2020-DON298,ebola-virus-disease-democratic-republic-of-the-congo-draft,2020-DON298,Assessment,"On 18 November 2020, the Ministry of Health of the Democratic Republic of the Congo declared the end of human-to-human transmission of EVD over in Equateur Province&nbsp;after two maximum incubation periods (42 days) had elapsed since the last confirmed case tested negative for the second time&nbsp;on 6 October 2020. However, there remains a risk of re-emergence of EVD because alert rates have remained sub-optimal in all affected and non-affected health zones, including death alerts throughout the outbreak, and cases may have gone undetected. In addition, Ebola virus is enzootic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and it can persist in some body fluids of survivors for several months which, in rare events, may result in secondary transmission.There are ongoing challenges for surveillance, including access to affected areas and community mistrust toward authorities and outbreak responders. Other health emergencies such as coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), cholera and measles outbreaks may jeopardize the country&rsquo;s ability to rapidly detect and respond to re-emergence of EVD cases.",
2021-DON309,2021-DON309,2021-DON309,Assessment,"Since 2005, there has been some limited, non-sustained human-to-human transmission of variant influenza viruses, but no ongoing community transmission has been identified. Current evidence suggests that these viruses have not acquired the ability of sustained transmission among humans, thus the likelihood is low.Swine influenza viruses circulate in swine populations in many regions of the world. Depending on geographic location, the genetic characteristics of these viruses differ. When an influenza virus that normally circulates in swine (but not people) is detected in a person, it is called a &ldquo;variant influenza virus&rdquo;. Most human cases are the result of exposure to swine influenza viruses through contact with infected swine or contaminated environments. Because these viruses continue to be detected in swine populations around the world, further human cases can be expected.Influenza viruses that infect pigs may be different from human influenza viruses. Thus, influenza vaccines against human influenza viruses are generally not expected to protect people from influenza viruses that normally circulate in pigs. In addition, pigs are susceptible to avian, human and swine influenza viruses; they may get infected with influenza viruses from different species at the same time. If this happens, it is possible for the genes of these viruses to mix and create a new virus. This type of major change in the influenza A viruses is known as antigenic shift. If this new virus causes illness in people and can be transmitted easily from person-to-person with no immunity, an influenza pandemic can occur.The risk assessment will be reviewed as needed should further epidemiological or virological information become available.All human infections caused by a novel influenza subtype are notifiable under the International Health Regulations (IHR) and State Parties to the IHR (2005) are required to immediately notify WHO of any laboratory-confirmed case of a recent human infection caused by an influenza A virus with the potential to cause a pandemic.

2020-DON302,2020-DON302,2020-DON302,Assessment,"Eight IgM positive cases were reported from four prefectures of Koundara district. Subsequent analysis by the regional reference laboratory IPD has confirmed yellow fever. The district is noted to have risk factors for a spread of the yellow fever virus, including documented Aedes species, parks inhabited by monkeys, forests extending to neighboring countries (Senegal, Guinea Bissau) and suboptimal YF vaccination coverage. The occurrence of suspected YF cases in urban and peri-urban areas with largely unvaccinated populations increases the risk of epidemic amplification.The risk at the national level is considered high because of the large number of cases with an unusual age profile of young children in a short period of time, with a focus in Koundara. The risk at the regional level is considered moderate given the geographic location of the suspected YF cases and potential population movements.",

2020-DON303,2020-DON303,2020-DON303,Assessment,"The detection of YF cases in the Tambacounda and Kedougou regions demonstrates the possibility of sylvatic spread of YF to unvaccinated people in a rural area and emphasizes the importance of maintaining high population immunity in all countries located in areas at high risk for YF. Recent epidemiological studies have reported that the villages are in a savanna area with non-human primates. Permanent or temporary pools of water are observed at the outskirts of residential areas.Although mass vaccination took place in Senegal in 2007, the eastern part of the country is considered to be at high risk of endemic YF transmission. Unvaccinated individuals remain vulnerable to infection with YF due to the persistence of the disease in primates (sylvatic cycle), especially in rural areas. The two affected regions are also difficult to reach, making vaccination efforts challenging. Intensive care units in the regions are far from the district (186 km) with poor road conditions. Affected districts are rural, largely consisted of forests, making it difficult to control the vector and mitigate the combined sylvatic-urban cycle.The COVID-19 pandemic poses a risk of disruption to routine immunization activities due to the burden on health systems and declining immunization uptake due to physical distancing or community reluctance. Disruption of immunization services, even for brief periods, will increase the number of susceptible individuals and increase the likelihood of outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases. As of 27 December 2020, there were 18 523 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 387 deaths reported in Senegal.",

2021-DON311,2021-DON311,2021-DON311,Assessment,"RVF outbreaks are recurrent in Kenya and there have been several RVF outbreaks in the past (1998, 2006-2007, 2014, 2018). The current outbreak affecting humans and animals in Isiolo (Ewaso Nyiro), Mandera (Dawa) and Garissa counties is associated with rivers flooding. There was no flooding/rainfall in Muranga; outbreaks are around swampy areas, and quarry lakes. Contact with infected animals was associated with human infection. Herders, farmers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians have an increased risk of infection. Isiolo and Garissa counties are pastoral communities (primarily sheep and goats) where livestock are grazed in communal grazing areas.The onset of the event began in Sericho, Isiolo county around 19 November 2020. RVF outbreaks were later reported in Balambala and Ijara Subcounties, Garissa county on 7 December 2020 that were attributed to flooding along the Ewaso Basin whose river burst its banks in early November 2020. This then led livestock to migrate and graze along the marshy areas of the nearby riverbank. The location of the event is currently reported in four counties within Kenya. Yet, given the favourable environmental conditions (heavy rainfall and flooding) that can increase the presence of disease vectors, along with uncontrolled movement of viraemic animals (in search of water and pasture), there is an increased risk of disease spreading to other parts within Kenya and to neighbouring countries. It should be highlighted that an RVF outbreak will have a severe economic impact on this pastoral community that is dependent on livestock production. The last animal vaccination for RVF was in 2018, but the exact coverage is unknown. Although the country has local capacity, response measures remain insufficient. Vector control measures have not been conducted and a national vector control plan has yet to be developed.The first confirmed COVID-19 case was registered in Kenya on 12 March 2020. As of 8 February 2021, Kenya had reported 101 819 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 1,779 deaths.. The impact of the pandemic has led to a wide-spread shortage of supplies necessary to mount an effective RVF response such as Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). Furthermore, surveillance officers and laboratory services have largely prioritised the COVID-19 response.",

2020-DON263,2020-DON263,2020-DON263,Assessment,"The risk at national level is assessed as high. The current outbreak in Gurage Zone, SNNP region shows rapid amplification of a yellow fever outbreak in a rural area. In the context of virtually no population immunity, the high number of suspect cases reported over a short time period is of high concern. The recent confirmation of the outbreak in cases with no history of travel is a concern. This is an indication of the existence of conducive factors for an increased incidence of yellow fever transmission and the spread of the disease beyond the hotspot areas.Recent entomological studies, in addition to previous entomological studies conducted in 2018, have indicated the presence of competent vectors including Aedes species and the potential for spread to surrounding zones. The onset of the rainy season could increase density of mosquito vectors, thereby further exacerbating risk of spread.Travellers returning to Ethiopia who may be infected with possible high levels of the virus in the blood may pose a risk for the establishment of local cycles of yellow fever transmission in areas where the competent vector is present.The last yellow fever outbreak occurred in the SNNP region in August 2018, with a total of 35 cases (30 suspected and 5 confirmed cases) reported from the Wolayita Zone in the SNNP region, Ethiopia. While immunization took place in selected aspects of Wolayita Zone, the communities in Gurage zone remain vulnerable to yellow fever infection.There is currently a low risk at the regional level due to limited population movement both nationally and internationally because of COVID-19 related controls on borders (air/land).WHO assesses the overall risk to be low at the global level.&nbsp;",

2020-DON245,2020-DON245,2020-DON245,Assessment,"Lassa fever is a viral haemorrhagic fever that is transmitted to humans via contact with food or household items contaminated with rodent urine or faeces. Secondary human-to-human transmission can also occur through direct contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other body fluids of infected persons, especially in health care settings.About 80% of persons infected with the Lassa virus are asymptomatic but in the remaining 20%, the illness manifests as a febrile illness of variable severity associated with multiple organ dysfunctions with or without haemorrhage. The overall case fatality ratio is usually between 1% and 15% among patients hospitalized with severe illness. Early supportive care with rehydration and symptomatic treatment improves survival. Lassa fever is known to be endemic in Benin, Guinea, Ghana, Liberia, Mali, Sierra Leone and Nigeria, but may exist in other West African countries.Although Nigeria is a Lassa fever endemic country and has developed capacity for managing Lassa fever outbreaks, the current overall risk is considered moderate at national level. Capacities at sub-national level remain suboptimal. Fifteen confirmed cases have been reported among healthcare workers in this outbreak and highlights the urgent need to strengthen IPC measures. Furthermore, country capacity to detect and respond to Lassa fever outbreaks needs to be improved (surveillance, laboratory, case management, coordination and IPC measures).The overall regional and global risk is considered to be low due to minimal number of suspected cross-border transmission from Nigeria to neighboring countries.&nbsp;",

Dynamics of the outbreak, however, remain contingent upon access for response teams to affected areas. Continued insecurity remains a barrier the outbreak response effort. The limited number of community deaths still occasionally reported among new EVD cases can perpetuate transmission, with potential for new cases to arise outside of groups under surveillance. Ebola virus may persist in some survivors&rsquo; body fluids. In a limited number of instances, secondary transmissions from exposure to body fluids of survivors have been documented. We should expect further clusters of cases following exposure to survivors&rsquo; infected body fluids in the coming few months. This risk can be mitigated through the dedicated programme for survivor care and monitoring. At both a national and regional level, potential limitations imposed on response and preparedness activities (e.g. shortages of funding, loss of access to communities due to deterioration in security, etc.), could reverse the gains that have been made in controlling the outbreak.&nbsp;",

2020-DON267,2020-DON267,2020-DON267,Assessment,"Measles is a highly contagious viral disease which affects susceptible individuals of all ages and remains one of the leading causes of death among young children globally, despite the availability of safe and effective measles-containing vaccines. The mode of transmission is airborne or via droplets from the nose, mouth, or throat of infected persons. Initial symptoms, which usually appear 10&ndash;12 days after infection, include high fever, usually accompanied by one of several of the following: runny nose, bloodshot eyes, cough, and tiny white spots on the inside of the mouth. Several days later, a rash develops, usually starting on the face and upper neck and gradually spreads downwards. A patient is infectious four days before the start of the rash to four days after the appearance of the rash. There is no specific antiviral treatment for measles and most people recover within 2&ndash;3 weeks.Among malnourished children and people with greater susceptibility, measles can also cause serious complications, including blindness, encephalitis, severe diarrhea, ear infection, and pneumonia. Measles can be prevented by immunization. In countries with low vaccination coverage, epidemics typically occur every two to three years and usually last between two and three months, although their duration varies according to population size, crowding, and the population&rsquo;s immunity status.Because of ongoing transmission, vaccination strategies and other actions are being implemented to control the outbreak by local and state level authorities in Mexico. There is a high risk of spreading of the virus due to high population density such as Mexico City, in which the high vaccination coverage could allow slow but steady transmission. At the regional level, the potential impact is considered moderate given the performance of routine immunization programs and prevention and control capacities in other countries in the region and the restrictions for travel in many countries and territories of the Region due to the pandemic of COVID-19.Due to the current COVID-19 pandemic, there might be a risk of disruption to routine immunization activities due to both COVID-19 related burden on the health system and decreased demand for vaccination because of physical distancing requirements or community reluctance. Disruption of immunization services, even for brief periods, can result in increased numbers of susceptible individuals and raise the likelihood of outbreak-prone vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs) such as measles.",

Its first outbreak was reported in February 2020 with cases imported from Linga health zone, based in the Godjoka health area.On the security level, there are reports of atrocities and violence linked to the militia CODECO which continues to impact the population of this territory (Djugu and its surroundings). There have been mass population displacements within Djugu and Mahagi Territories. Currently, the Rethy Health Zone has received approximately 112 714 internally displaced persons (IDPs), most of whom have come from the Jiba and Linga Health Zone. The growing insecurity impacts traffic flow between the villages and the willingness of the population to either stay or work in that area. There has also been a deterioration of water, hygiene and sanitation conditions in the reception areas and in the IDP sites.The early detection and reporting of the current outbreak by healthcare workers demonstrate that a functioning surveillance system is in place. Ituri province had a reference laboratory in Bunia which is no longer functional. The Institut National de la Recherce Biomedicale (INRB) laboratory based in Kinshasa/DRC has the ability to conduct laboratory testing for suspected cases. However, delays in shipping samples from Rethy to Bunia and then to Kinshasa, and delays in testing in Kinshasa INRB due to high workload and backload related to COVID-19 samples to be tested, might jeopardize the surveillance and response. Ongoing efforts are required to ensure that any other cases are promptly detected, isolated, and investigated to avoid the establishment of local transmission.The risk at national level is considered to be moderate given: the evolution of the current situation is in danger of deteriorating rapidly (case fatality rate: 20%), the notification of cases of pulmonary plague, the challenges with the surveillance system and delays between sample collection and laboratory confirmation, and the volatile security situation and the existence of other epidemics in progress in the country which prevents the setting up of a more comprehensive response. Furthermore, the health zone currently does not have enough PPE, body bags and materials needed for decontamination. Malteser International, an NGO that supplies the health zone with drugs, has had difficulty getting the products into the zone because of insecurity on the RN27 road.The principles of control are known and have been implemented (early treatment with the recommended antibiotics, isolation of the pneumonic cases, chemoprophylaxis given to the close contacts of the latest ones, rodent and flea control, safe and dignified burials, and the prevention of nosocomial transmission) but the means are limited and the health system is unable to manage the cases in the most appropriate way. The antibiotics used for the treatment of the cases are Doxycycline, Ciprofloxacin and Cotrimoxazole. For the pulmonary or septicemic form case, Gentamycin was administrated. The lack of laboratory confirmation is worrying but the use of rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) on the field ensures a minimum of confirmation among the suspected cases. The RDTs are especially reliable to confirm bubonic plague suspected forms.The risk at regional level is considered low since the epidemic seems to be contained in the Rethy health zone and that it is an isolated region. The risk is considered low globally.",

Vaccination is the most important means of preventing the infection.&nbsp;French Guiana is considered at risk for yellow fever transmission. Vaccination coverage in French Guiana is very high and expected to be protective against large-scale yellow fever outbreaks; however, the coverage in some specific populations (especially from the Amazonian area) could be suboptimal and therefore at risk for yellow fever infections.&nbsp;As several countries and territories in the yellow fever endemic areas are also experiencing an intense transmission of SARS-CoV-2, further cases with co-infection may occur. Similarly, the co-circulation of yellow fever virus and SARS-CoV-2 in areas with higher bed occupancy rates in Intensive Care Units, pose an additional challenge for case management and infection and prevention control activities.With the global circulation of the virus causing COVID-19, there is a risk of disruption of access to health care due to both COVID-19 related burden on the health system and health care workers. The Pandemic has also led to decreased demand for health care and impacted the routine vaccination activities because of physical distancing requirements. An increase in the number of yellow fever cases or other vaccine preventable diseases (VPD) may result in increased morbidity and mortality predominantly in young infants and other vulnerable groups.Another aspect in consideration in the light of the current COVID-19 pandemic, is the capacity of the local laboratories and national reference laboratories to process samples due the over demand in processing COVID-19 samples.

Epidemic spread of yellow fever is a risk in Uganda as the estimated overall population immunity is low (4.2%), and attributable to past reactive vaccination activities in focal districts that are not affected by the current outbreak.Due to the negligible population immunity in the affected districts, the detection of yellow fever cases is concerning. The affected districts share international borders with both DRC and South Sudan; and are marked by frequent population movements and high interconnectivity. Population immunity for yellow fever in the cross-border areas is also low and the forest biome between countries is continuous, indicating that there is a risk of international spread. Close monitoring of the situation with active cross-border coordination and information sharing is needed as the possibility of cases in neighbouring countries and risk of onward spreading to DRC and South Sudan cannot be completely excluded.",
2020-DON305,2020-DON305,2020-DON305,Assessment,"All viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, change over time, most without a direct benefit to the virus in terms of increasing its infectiousness or transmissibility, and sometimes limiting propagation (see&nbsp;Q&amp;A on COVID-19 and related health topics&nbsp;). The potential for virus mutation increases with the frequency of human and animal infections. Therefore, reducing transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by using established disease control methods as well as avoiding introductions to animal populations, are critical aspects to the global strategy to reduce the occurrence of mutations that have negative public health implications.Preliminary data suggest that the growth rate and effective reproductive number is elevated in areas of the United Kingdom with community circulation of the novel variant VOC-202012/01. In South Africa, genomic data highlighted that the 501Y.V2 variant rapidly displaced other lineages circulating, and preliminary studies suggest the variant is associated with a higher viral load, which may suggest potential for increased transmissibility; however, this, as well as other factors that influence transmissibility, are subject of further investigation. Epidemiologic investigations are underway to understand the increase in cases in these communities and the potential role of increased transmissibility of these variants as well as the robustness of implementation of control measures. While initial assessment suggests that 202012/01 and 501Y.V2 do not cause changes in clinical presentation or severity, if they result in a higher case incidence, this would lead to an increase in COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths. More intensive public health measures may be required to control transmission of these variants.Further investigations are required to understand the impact of specific mutations on viral properties and the effectiveness of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines. These investigations are complex and require time and collaboration among different research groups. These studies are ongoing.",

0,cholera-togo,0,Assessment,"Cholera is an acute enteric infectious disease caused by ingesting water or food contaminated with&nbsp;V. cholerae&nbsp;bacteria. Cholera is a potentially serious disease, causing high rates of morbidity and mortality in the absence of timely treatment. Due to the short incubation period of cholera, outbreaks can develop rapidly depending on the frequency of exposure, the population exposed, and the context involved.Cholera outbreaks have previously occurred in Togo with the last outbreak reported in 2016. The city of Lom&eacute;, currently affected by the outbreak, is one of the known hotspots for cholera. In addition, Togo borders countries where this disease is endemic. A cholera outbreak in the Togolese capital, Lom&eacute;, with a population estimated at around of 2 000 000, has so far amounted to 67 suspected cholera cases including two deaths (CFR 3%) of which 17 have been confirmed by culture between 11 November to 28 December 2020.The currently affected health zones (Katanga, Adakpam&eacute;, Gb&eacute;tsogb&eacute; and Kangnikop&eacute;) are mostly located in port areas with poor hygiene and sanitation conditions. Strong response activities are necessary to prevent the possible spread, given the fishing activities carried out in the affected localities that attract inhabitants from several districts of Lom&eacute; and other regions of Togo as well as Lom&eacute;&rsquo;s proximity to Ghana and Benin. One imported confirmed cholera case and one secondary case were reported in the Netherlands in travelers from Togo. The index case was infected in Togo and upon return to the Netherlands tested positive for cholera on 17 November. The partner of the index case developed cholera-like symptoms including &lsquo;rice water&rsquo; diarrhea and vomiting and is considered to have acquired the disease through secondary transmission via the index. Even though there is no risk for further spread of the disease in the Netherlands this event represents an international spread.Togolese health authorities have been implementing all necessary response measures, nevertheless, the possibility of exportation of additional cases to other countries cannot be excluded.With the current COVID-19 pandemic, there is a risk of disruption to health care access due to both COVID-19 related burden on the health system and health care workers and a decreased demand because of physical distancing requirements or community reluctance.Another aspect to take into consideration during the current COVID-19 pandemic, is the capacity of the local and national reference laboratories to handle cholera testing due to the over demand in processing COVID-19 samples. As of 3 January 2021, Togo reported 3 683 of COVID 19 cases with 68 deaths.",

It remains one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality among young children globally, despite the availability of a safe and effective vaccine. Transmission from person-to-person is airborne, as well as by direct or indirect contact of secretions (nasal, throat) of an infected person. The virus can cause widespread outbreaks in the presence of large numbers of susceptible persons.
Even with implementation of outbreak response measures, measles continues to circulate in the European Region as a result of suboptimal vaccination coverage and population immunity gaps. If outbreak response is not timely and comprehensive, the virus will find its way into more pockets of vulnerable individuals and potentially spread to additional countries within and beyond the Region. It is proportional to the size of the population that remains susceptible to measles. Measles has also been reported among health workers and nosocomial transmission has contributed to some outbreaks.
The impact on public health will persist until the ongoing outbreaks are controlled, routine immunization coverage is continuously high (&ge; 95%) and immunity gaps in the population closed.

The causative agent belongs to the genus&nbsp;Hantavirus, family&nbsp;Bunyaviridae. The infection is acquired primarily through inhalation of aerosols or contact with infected rodent excreta, droppings, or saliva of infected rodents. Cases of human hantavirus infection usually occur in rural areas (e.g. forests, fields, and farms) where sylvatic rodents hosting the virus might be found and where persons may be exposed to the virus. This disease is characterized by headache, dizziness, chills fever, myalgia, and gastrointestinal problems, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, followed by sudden onset of respiratory distress and hypotension. Symptoms of HPS typically occur from two to four weeks after initial exposure to the virus. However, symptoms may appear as early as one week and as late as eight weeks following exposure. The case-fatality rate can reach 35-50%.In the Americas, HPS cases have been reported in several countries. Environmental and ecological factors affecting rodent populations can have a seasonal impact on disease trends. Since the reservoir for hantavirus is sylvatic rodents, mainly&nbsp;Sigmodontinae&nbsp;species, transmission can occur when people come in contact with the rodent habitat. Limited human-to-human transmission of HPS due to&nbsp;Andes virus&nbsp;in Argentina has been previously documented. There are no specific evidence-based procedures for HPS patient isolation.

2019DON998,17-january-2019-measles-madagascar-en,2019DON998,Assessment,"Measles is an acute, highly contagious viral disease that has potential to lead to major epidemics. Low coverage with measles vaccine combined with a low incidence of measles in recent years in Madagascar has contributed to a significant proportion of the population which is susceptible to measles. According to WHO and UNICEF estimates, the measles immunization coverage in Madagascar was 58% in 2017. The malnutrition rate is also a contributor as malnutrition increases children's vulnerability of serious complications and death from measles infection.WHO estimates the overall risk for Madagascar from this measles outbreak to be very high. Currently, several concomitant factors are likely to hinder or delay public health intervention and might jeopardize the response: post-election conflict, geographical isolation and remoteness of cases, insecurity, hurricane season and multiple outbreaks. Targeted immunization campaigns and strengthening of routine immunization activities are paramount in the effective control of the outbreak. Administration of Vitamin A, specifically in a context of high rates of malnutrition, can reduce illness and deaths from measles infection.The risk at the regional level is low although the spread of measles to neighboring Indian Ocean islands and other African countries and Europe cannot be excluded. Strengthening of surveillance in neighboring countries is recommended. The overall global risk is considered to be low.",

There is no specific treatment, although the disease is preventable using a single dose of yellow fever vaccine, which provides immunity for life. Supportive care to treat dehydration, respiratory failure and fever and antibiotic treatment for associated bacterial infections is recommended.The YF outbreak has been active in Nigeria since September 2017. Cases are reported from 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory. The recent confirmation by the regional reference laboratory of the YF outbreak in Edo State, with the probable epicentre in Uhunmwonde LGA, represents an unprecedented outbreak in Nigeria. Given the rapid evolution of the situation in Edo State, the national risk is assessed as high due to: the high presumptive case fatality rate (33%) in Edo State; the potential for ongoing local transmission and amplification due to low vaccination coverage; presence of competent vectors including Aedes sp.; the proximity of a case to Benin City (major urban centre and capital of Edo State); and the potential spread to new LGAs.There is currently a moderate risk at regional level due to the possible movement of the individuals of affected states to adjacent areas and neighbouring countries and particularly if there is arrival of unvaccinated visitors over the festive end of year season.

The nine neighbouring countries were categorized into three priority levels based on their capacity to manage EVD and viral haemorrhagic fever (VHF) outbreaks and proximity to the affected areas (Figure 1). The nine countries were categorized as follows, with priority 1 being the highest:Priority 1: Central Africa Republic and Republic of Congo due to their proximity to the current event. These two countries share borders with the epicentre of the outbreak in Equateur Province and there is continuous population movement through the porous land borders and by the Congo and Oubangui rivers.Priority 2: Angola, Burundi, Rwanda, South Sudan, Tanzania and Zambia which neighbour the Democratic Republic of the Congo but are not directly linked with Equateur Province.Priority 3: Uganda because although it borders the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda has regularly demonstrated the capacity to respond to recent previous VHF outbreaks.Figure 1.

First, the refugee camps particularly Kakuma and Dadaab, and second in the populous Nairobi capital county. Both settings are concerning, considering the overcrowded conditions and limited access to care in the first setting, and the high population density in the second setting. This could enable the spread of the outbreak to other districts. Also, previous outbreaks have shown that cases increase during the rainy season, which has started recently.In addition, various physical, social, political, and environmental factors increase the vulnerability and the susceptibility of the country&rsquo;s population to the cholera outbreaks. These include regional drought, conflict, and insecurity in the Horn of Africa, and the increased movement within and to the country by people fleeing conflicts in Somalia and South Sudan.Overall, the risk of the current outbreak is assessed as high at the national level and low at the regional and global levels.",
2017-DON5,11-december-2017-cholera-zambia-en,2017-DON5,Assessment,"The current outbreak is occurring in Zambia&rsquo;s largest city, Lusaka. The main affected sub-districts, Chipata and Kanyama, are densely populated and have an inadequate water and sanitation infrastructure, which may favour the spread of the disease. The sources of infection transmission in this outbreak have been associated with contaminated water supplies, contaminated food, inadequate sanitation and poor hygiene practices.The coming of the rainy season, coupled with inadequate water supply and sanitation increases the risk of outbreaks in Lusaka and other parts of the country. Adequate supplies for cholera response should be obtained as part of preparedness activities.Zambia hosts about 60 000 refugees (as of September 2017) from neighbouring countries. A large proportion of refugees are from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and are mostly residing in Nchelenge refugee camp located more than 1000 km distant from Lusaka. The influx of refugees has led to overcrowded settlements with high needs for shelter, healthcare and WASH facilities. Most refugees are in poor health condition, especially children; therefore, risk of disease outbreaks is high. Sanitation is a challenge at hosting sites. Given the security situation in DRC, further influx of refugees is expected.",

2017DON103,24-november-2017-yellow-fever-brazil-en,2017DON103,Assessment,"These are the first human cases of yellow fever that have been reported in Brazil since June 2017. These cases, alongside the occurrence of epizootics in the urban area of S&atilde;o Paulo City and in municipalities that were previously considered not at risk for yellow fever, are a public health concern. Although Brazilian health authorities have swiftly implemented a series of public health measures in response to this event, including mass vaccination campaigns, it may take some time to reach optimal coverage in these areas given the large number of susceptible individuals. Currently, the number of unvaccinated people in S&atilde;o Paulo City remains high at around 10 million. If yellow fever transmission continues to spread to areas that were previously considered not at risk for yellow fever, ensuring the availability of vaccine and implementing control measures would pose significant challenges.To date, there has been no evidence of transmission by Aedes aegypti in relation to this outbreak in Brazil which began in 2016. Although entomological studies conducted in selected municipalities of S&atilde;o Paulo revealed low levels of Ae. aegypti and Aedes albopictus infestation (pupa index range: 0% &ndash; 3.1%), the risk of sustained arbovirus transmission is ever present.The risk of spread at the regional level is considered to be low given the high vaccination coverage in neighbouring countries; however, the detection of a human case of yellow fever in Oiapoque, the border river between French Guiana and Brazil in August 2017 by French health authorities indicates that the risk of regional spread exists. The risk at the global level is considered to be low and limited only to unvaccinated travellers returning from affected areas. Travelers who return home while infected with yellow fever virus may increase the risk of establishing local cycles of yellow fever transmission in areas where the competent vector is present.WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and assess the risk according to the latest available information.",
2017DON104,15-november-2017-plague-madagascar-en,2017DON104,Assessment,"Since mid-October, the number of new cases of plague, the number of hospitalizations of patients due to plague, and the number of geographic districts reporting plague has decreased. While the declining trend in new plague case reports and reduction in hospitalizations due to plague are encouraging signs, WHO expects more cases of plague to be reported from Madagascar until the typical plague season ends in April 2018.The decline in case reports suggests that the epidemic phase of the outbreak is ending, however sustaining ongoing operations is critical to minimize bubonic plague infections and human-to-human transmission of pneumonic plague.The trend in the number of new cases of plague has been declining for more than a month, indicating that measures taken to contain the outbreak have been effective. WHO is working with the Ministry of Health in Madagascar and other partners to maintain ongoing outbreak control efforts, including active case finding and treatment, comprehensive contact identification, follow-up and antibiotic treatment, rodent and flea control, and safe and dignified burials through this outbreak and the plague season into 2018, and to outline a longer term strategy for plague preparedness and control.Since the beginning of this outbreak, the vast majority of cases, and more than 7000 contact persons, have been treated and have recovered. As of 15 November 2017, only 12 people are hospitalized for plague. There has been no international spread outside the country.Based on available information and response measures implemented to date, WHO estimates the risk of potential further spread of the plague outbreak at national level remains high. The risk of international spread is mitigated by the short incubation period of pneumonic plague, implementation of exit screening measures and advice to travellers to Madagascar, and scaling up of preparedness and operational readiness activities in neighbouring Indian Ocean islands and other southern and east African countries. The overall global risk is considered to be low. WHO is re-evaluating the risk assessment based on the evolution of the outbreak and information from response activities.Advice on prevention and control measures and treatment options has been provided to Madagascar and to priority countries in the region.&nbsp;",
2017DON105,15-november-2017-marburg-uganda-kenya-en,2017DON105,Assessment,"Marburg virus disease is an emerging and highly virulent epidemic-prone disease associated with high case fatality rates (CFR: 23 to 90%). Marburg virus disease outbreaks are rare. The virus is transmitted by direct contact with the blood, body fluids and tissues of infected persons or wild animals (e.g. monkeys and fruit bats).Candidate experimental therapeutics are being reviewed for potential clinical trials.As of 15 November, the current outbreak has affected three cases, all of whom have died. One of the confirmed cases travelled to Kenya prior to his death. However, so far no secondary case has been confirmed outside of Uganda.Uganda has previous experience in managing recurring Ebola and Marburg virus disease outbreaks. Cases have historically been reported among miners and travellers who visited caves inhabited by bat colonies in Uganda. Kenya on the other hand has limited experience and has been facing a healthcare worker strike which could delay any public health response. Cross-border population movement and community mixing between Uganda and Kenya may increase the risk of cross-border spread.Ugandan health authorities have responded quickly to this event, and measures are being rapidly implemented to control the outbreak. Kenyan health authorities have activated the contingency plan and the public health EOC and have started preparedness measures. The high number of potential contacts in extended families, at healthcare facilities and surrounding traditional burial ceremonies was a challenge for the response.The affected districts are in a rural, mountainous area located on the border with Kenya, about 300km northeast of Kampala on the northern slopes of Mount Elgon National Park. The Mount Elgon caves are a major tourist attraction, and are host to large colonies of cave-dwelling fruit bats, known to transmit the Marburg virus. The close proximity of the affected area to the Kenyan border, and cross-border movement between the affected district and Kenya and the potential transmission of the virus between bat colonies and to humans, increases the risk of cross-border spread.These factors suggest a high risk at national and regional level, requiring an immediate, coordinated response with support from international partners.

MVD cases have historically been reported among miners and travellers who visited caves inhabited by bat colonies in Uganda. Marburg virus disease outbreaks have been documented during:2007 &ndash; 4 cases, including 2 deaths in Ibanda District, Western Uganda;2008 &ndash; 2 unrelated cases in travellers returning to the Netherlands and USA, respectively after visiting caves in Western Uganda;2012 &ndash; 15 cases, including 4 deaths in Ibanda and Kabale districts, Western Uganda; and2014 &ndash; 1 case in healthcare professional from Mpigi District, Central Uganda.Currently, three cases have been identified; two confirmed and one probable case. The second confirmed case travelled to Kenya prior to his death, but so far no human-to-human transmission has been confirmed outside of Uganda. Ugandan health authorities have responded rapidly to this event, and measures are being rapidly implemented to control the outbreak. Kenyan health authorities have activated the contingency plan and the public health EOC and have started preparedness measures. The high number of potential contacts in extended families, at healthcare facilities and surrounding traditional burial ceremonies is a challenge for the response.The affected districts are in a rural, mountainous area located on the border with Kenya, about 300km northeast of Kampala on the northern slopes of Mount Elgon National Park.

The weekly case incidence has been on the rise since the detection of the outbreak in week 31 and is likely underestimated. The epidemic has already spread to twelve of the country's thirteen health zones and many public health facilities do not have access to dengue fever diagnostics (RDTs).Burkina Faso experienced an outbreak of dengue in 2016 which was caused by DENV-2. In the current outbreak, three serotypes were identified: DENV-1, DENV-2, and DENV-3. This could lead to the occurrence of more severe cases, which may not be captured by the surveillance system due to under-reporting from private clinics and healthcare centers in peripheral districts.The existence of multiple mosquito breeding sites after the rainy season may favor the continued presence of mosquito populations in the affected communities In particular, the peripheral districts of cities in Burkina Faso are characterized by poor sanitation and the accumulation of rubbish dump sites, tires and used containers which provide productive breeding sites for&nbsp;Aedes aegypti&nbsp;mosquitoes (the primary vector for dengue).",

Plague bacillus,&nbsp;Yersinia pestis, enters at the bite and travels through the lymphatic system to the nearest lymph node where it replicates itself. The lymph node then becomes inflamed, tense and painful, and is called a """"bubo"""". At advanced stages of the infection the inflamed lymph nodes can turn into open sores filled with puss.Pneumonic plague-or lung-based plague- is the most virulent form of plague.

This suggests that the virus is spreading, and emphasizes that further intensive surveillance and control measures in both human and animal health sector are crucial.According to the epidemiological curve, the number of reported cases on a weekly basis seems to have peaked in early February and is slowly decreasing. The peak in cases this year corresponds to the timing of the peak in cases in previous years.Most human cases are exposed to avian influenza A(H7N9) virus through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments, including live poultry markets. Since the virus continues to be detected in animals and environments, and live poultry vending continues, further human cases can be expected. Additional sporadic human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) in other provinces in China that have not yet reported human cases are also expected. Similarly, sporadic human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) detected in countries bordering China would not be unexpected. Although small clusters of cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus have been reported including those involving patients in the same ward, current epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that this virus has not acquired the ability of sustained transmission among humans. Therefore the likelihood of further community level spread is considered low.Close analysis of the epidemiological situation and further characterization of the most recent viruses are critical to assess associated risk and to adjust risk management measures in a timely manner.",
2017DON132,19-july-2017-dengue-sri-lanka-en,2017DON132,Assessment,"Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne viral infection caused by four dengue virus serotypes (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4). Infection with one serotype provides long-term immunity to the homologous serotype but not to the other serotypes; secondary infections put people at greater risk for severe dengue fever and dengue shock syndrome.Aedes aegypti&nbsp;and&nbsp;Aedes albopictus&nbsp;are the vectors widely adapted to urban and suburban environments. Dengue fever is endemic in Sri Lanka, and occurs every year, usually soon after rainfall is optimal for mosquito breeding. However DENV-2 has been identified only in low numbers since 2009 and is reportedly over 50% of current specimens which have been serotyped.The current dengue epidemic is likely to have repercussions on public health in Sri Lanka.",

The areas of insecurity are located in north-eastern Nigeria, bordering Republic of the Niger, Cameroon, and Chad. The hepatitis E outbreak is taking place in this same area.This area is characterized by a hepatitis E outbreak in neighbouring Chad and in Republic of the Niger. The ongoing humanitarian crisis and insecurity, high numbers of Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) and refugees, and poor access to safe water leads to the spread of disease. There are also an increasing number of displaced persons moving back to the region post occupation. In addition, the potential cross-border contamination and subsequent increased risk of spread from Republic of the Niger and other neighbouring countries should be considered. There are a number of refugee and IDP camps that are overcrowded and have poor sanitation conditions thereby increasing the risk of hepatitis E. Therefore the observed risk at the national level is high.The risk at regional level is moderate especially in the countries around the humanitarian crisis in north-eastern Nigeria.

Vaccination is the most important means of preventing the infection.Suriname is a country with a risk of yellow fever transmission in endemic areas. Vaccination is recommended before travelling to Suriname for all travellers aged nine months and older. Suriname requires proof of vaccination against yellow fever for all travellers over one year of age.Suriname introduced the yellow fever vaccination into the routine program for all children aged one years old in 2014.The estimate of national immunization coverage is 86% and only includes children aged one years old. The unvaccinated populations living in the endemic areas are at high risk of yellow fever infection.The current report of a travel-associated case provides evidence to consider local transmission of yellow fever in the country. More investigations are also needed for animal health sectors.In addition, Suriname shares borders with Brazil, which has been experiencing yellow fever outbreaks since January 2017 (the largest outbreak of yellow fever in the Americas in the past three decades).Sequencing and comparison to cases from various other countries is still ongoing, but it is likely that the case is not related to the yellow fever outbreak in Brazil.As South America is currently experiencing a cyclical increase in the number of cases in non-human primates and human cases, an increase in the number of cases in unvaccinated travellers returning from affected areas in South America is not unexpected. The risk of spread of the disease by non-immunized travellers from Suriname to the countries that have the vector for the transmission of the yellow fever virus is considered to be low but cannot be ruled out.Currently, five countries in South America report yellow fever virus activity: Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Colombia and Ecuador. This multi-country yellow fever virus activity might reflect current, wide-spread ecological conditions that favour elevated yellow fever virus transmissibility among wildlife and spill-over to humans. The sequencing analysis of currently circulating strains in Brazil, Bolivia, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador and Suriname should provide insight whether the human cases in these countries are epidemiologically linked or represent multiple, independent spill-over events without extensive ongoing community transmission.",

Similar changes at the cleavage site of the HA gene were also found in genetic sequence data uploaded in Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID) of a virus from a recent human case reported by Taiwan, China earlier to WHO on 4 February 2017 with travel history to Guangdong. In addition the Ministry of Agriculture China reported to World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) on 21 February 2017 that genetic sequences of virus samples from live poultry markets in Guangdong also showed changes consistent with highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses. So far the above genetic changes have been found in viruses from human, poultry and environmental samples from Guangdong or with travel history to Guangdong province.In addition the genetic sequences from the two human cases from Guangdong and the case reported by Taiwan, China showed amino acid substitutions associated with neuraminidase inhibitor antiviral drug resistance. It was reported that the three patients received antiviral treatment before samples were taken.So far there is no evidence of change of epidemiological patterns of avian influenza A(H7N9) infection in humans. There is no evidence that a change in the virus from low pathogenic to high pathogenic avian influenza virus has an impact on the pathogenicity or transmissibility in humans.Overall the likelihood of further community level spread remains low.WHO is closely monitoring the impact of these viruses on public health through its Global Influenza Surveillance and Research System (GISRS) network, and its effect on animal health through collaboration with Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and OIE, and will update public health risk assessment accordingly.A change in the virus from low pathogenicity to highly pathogenicity in poultry may have implications on surveillance and control strategies at the animal sector.",
2017DON176,24-february-2017-yellow-fever-brazil-en,2017DON176,Assessment,"The growing number of reported cases, the detection of yellow fever circulation in new states, and the occurrence of epizootics in areas that were previously not considered at risk of yellow fever transmission indicate that the geographic extent of the outbreak is increasing. Although Brazilian health authorities have swiftly implemented a series of public health measures to control the outbreak, including mass vaccination campaigns, it may take some time to reach optimal coverage in some of the areas at risk as a large portion of the affected populations are dispersed and live in remote locations. It is, therefore, expected that in the near term additional cases will continued to be detected.To date, in the three states with laboratory-confirmed yellow fever human cases, there has been no evidence of transmission by Aedes aegypti; nevertheless, entomological indices in urban centers of these three states are sufficiently high for sustaining arbovirus transmission, as evidenced by documented outbreaks of dengue, chikungunya and Zika outbreak in late 2016.The reports of suspected epizootics in the rural areas of states bordering Argentina, Paraguay, and Bolivia are a cause of concern as the outbreak may potentially spread to one or more of these countries due to favourable conditions for yellow fever transmission and suboptimal levels of vaccination coverage. The introduction of the virus in these countries could potentially trigger large epidemics of yellow fever.In view of the evolving situation, and considering that travellers for the Carnival in the next few weeks may take side tours outside the main cities, a further spread within Brazil cannot be excluded. Likewise, the risk of international spread cannot be formally ruled out but this risk is currently considered to be very low and limited to unvaccinated travellers returning from affected areas. Viraemic returning travellers may pose a risk for the establishment of local cycles of yellow fever transmission predominantly in areas where the competent vector is present.WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conduct risk assessment based on the latest available information.",

Since August 2016, out of 196 specimen tested, only 17 patients have been confirmed with RVF, including 2 confirmed in November 2016 and 2 in October 2016. The epidemiological data are showing that the RVF outbreak amplitude is modest.The spread of the RVF outbreak to previously unaffected areas should still be monitored as the health infrastructure is limited and the areas and populations dispersed along the stock routes.The stockbreeder population is highly mobile and moves along stock routes to find pasture for their herds in the Sahel region that incorporates a number of neighbouring countries. The RVF outbreak caused concern and posed a serious public health threat in Niger as the health infrastructure is limited and populations are dispersed along the stock routes. Surrounding countries previously considered at risk including Mali, Burkina Faso, Nigeria, Chad, Benin, Togo and Cameroon have not reported any RVF cases.Although there is no indication at this point in time for an infectious disease which is easily spreading between humans there is a need to broaden the investigation to identify additional causing aetiologies as this would have an influence on the necessary response and control activities.",
2016DON202,18-november-2016-dengue-burkina-faso-en,2016DON202,Assessment,"Dengue has occurred in the context of low establishment of dengue surveillance in Burkina Faso. Many health facilities do not have access to dengue RDT. Case definitions and case management guidelines are not sufficiently disseminated therefore healthcare workers are not well trained on dengue surveillance, specifically case detection and notification. Awareness of the disease among health care workers and prevention is lacking as the surveillance of this disease is not well established despite an IDSR mechanism.Although the rainy season has ended, the potential for a high density of mosquitoes is still present as vector breeding sites at household and community level are numerous. Discussions are ongoing among stakeholders and entomologists on vector control interventions in the community. Vector control measures should identify the most productive breeding sites (identify where most larval density is detected) and identify reduction measures with active support of the community should be initiated. Entomological monitoring in select sites should be carried out to assess impact of all control measures. The use of mosquito nets for hospitalised viraemic patients should be considered. In addition, prevention measures at the individual level should be taken.Furthermore, it is important to highlight that the focus for healthcare workers and the general public is malaria rather than dengue. Therefore, there is a need to strengthen early diagnosis capacity, community awareness through communication, social mobilization, community engagement interventions, vector control and to reinforce clinical management guidance to better respond to this outbreak.Ouagadougou is the capital of Burkina Faso with major roads routes and rail links to neighbouring countries and an international airport. Additionally, there is frequent movement of populations to and from neighbouring countries. Currently there is no evidence indicating dengue outbreaks in the neighbouring regions, however the prior circulation of dengue virus cannot be ruled out. Insufficient information is available to assess this risk.",

2016DON206,13-october-2016-monkeypox-caf-en,2016DON206,Assessment,"Small scale monkeypox outbreaks regularly occur in tropical Africa. Monkeypox is usually transmitted to humans through contact with an infected animal or through infected animal bites. Person-to-person transmission can also occur during outbreaks through close contact with patients but there is no evidence to date that person-to-person transmission alone can sustain monkeypox transmission in humans.Given the lack of adequately equipped isolation units in healthcare facilities in the area and the known transmission dynamics of monkeypox between humans, the WHO encourages individuals and healthcare workers to follow infection prevention and control procedures when caring for patients, to prevent transmission of disease.Given the location of the outbreak in a relatively remote and sparsely populated area at this stage the risk of international spread seems limited.The WHO does not recommend any restriction for travel and trade to Central African Republic based on available information at this point in time.",

2016DON208,29-september-2016-rift-valley-fever-niger-en,2016DON208,Assessment,"Based on the available information, the event risk assessment is ongoing. The risk of further spread of outbreak within Niger and internationally (especially to neighbouring countries and those on the transhumance and migration routes) cannot be ruled out.Nomadic stockbreeders from Niger and neighbouring countries have just participated in the Cure Sal&eacute;e festival, a major annual mass gathering event from 23 to 25 September. During this festival, herds are brought to graze on the salty pastures ahead of the dry season. Around 2 million cattle and even more small ruminants were expected to be part of the event.At the end of the rainy season, as per known migration patterns, the nomadic human population along with their herds will progressively move to other Southern Sub Saharan countries and irrigation systems along the Niger river where pastures may still be available. In conjunction with the ongoing outbreak, the high density of animals in the area and the transhumance pattern significantly increases the risk of international spread.

A mutation in the E1 gene and selection chikungunya virus strains that increase adaptation of the virus to one of the vector&nbsp;Aedes albopictus&nbsp;and therefore significantly increase transmissibility has likely occurred in Reunion Island at the end of 2005 and resulted in an unprecedented outbreak and a further spread to the rest of the world.If confirmed the preliminary sequencing results the circulation of the mutated chikungunya stain could yield significantly higher attack rate than with the formerly circulating African strain.&nbsp;Ae albopictus&nbsp;is an invasive species that continues to expand geographically in various parts of the world, could therefore represent a further risk of geographical extension the current outbreak in the affected countries and beyond .The risk for a moderate to high scale outbreak of Chikungunya in the area cannot be ruled out due to the presence of the disease vector, immunologically naive population and potential upcoming rains in the area. Besides potential cross border span of the outbreak, under-reporting of cases and low levels of health seeking behaviours among the affected population is concerning.",
2016DON215,02-august-2016-rift-valley-fever-china-en,2016DON215,Assessment,"RVF is a viral zoonosis that primarily affects animals but can also infect humans.

The study provides strong evidence of a possible causal relationship between Zika virus infection and GBS. Since all 42 cases had serological tests suggesting successive dengue and Zika virus infections, this association might be a predisposing factor for developing GBS. Further investigations are needed to understand the implications of pre-existing dengue infections, together with recent Zika infections, in the pathogenesis of GBS.Similarly to French Polynesia, it is likely that countries that are currently reporting autochthonous Zika virus transmission will face a rise in the number of GBS cases in the coming months. A number of countries in Latin America have already started to report an increase in the incidence of GBS while experiencing a rise in the cases of Zika virus infection. Nevertheless, it is critical to ensure that in all these countries, the reported increases in the incidence of GBS are the result of a real change rather than enhanced surveillance.

A robust outbreak response can rapidly stop such events. Given substantial vaccination coverage gaps across the country and subnational surveillance deficits, the risk of further spread of this strain within the country is deemed to be high. The emergence of cVDPV strains underscores the importance of maintaining high levels of routine vaccination coverage. WHO currently assesses the risk of international spread from Ukraine to be low, but notes that the infected oblast shares borders with four countries (Romania, Hungary, Slovakia and Poland).WHO emphasises the need for a full and complete implementation of an outbreak response of the internationally-agreed standard. WHO will continue to evaluate the epidemiological situation and outbreak response measures being implemented.",
