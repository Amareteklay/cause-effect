MVD is an epidemic-prone disease associated with (C1) high CFR (24-88%) (C1).

2024-DON540,Healthcare-associated infections (also known as nosocomial infections) of this disease,further spread,hospital infections,disease spread,"Epidemiologic features can help differentiate between viral hemorrhagic fevers (including history of exposure to bats, caves, or mining) and laboratory testing is important to confirm the diagnosis. With 62 confirmed cases reported, this is the third largest MVD outbreak reported, with the majority of confirmed cases reported among healthcare workers. (C1) Healthcare-associated infections (also known as nosocomial infections) of this disease (C1) can lead to (E1) further spread (E1) if not controlled early.",healthcare misc.
2024-DON540,,,No context,No context,"The importance of screening all persons entering health facilities as well as inpatient surveillance for prompt identification, isolation, and notification cannot be overemphasized. This is in addition to the importance of contact identification and monitoring of all probable and confirmed cases. The source of the outbreak, the likely date of onset of the first case and additional epidemiological information on cases are still pending further outbreak investigation. On 30 September WHO assessed the risk of this outbreak as very high at the national level, high at the regional level, and low at the global level.",Uncategorized

Despite this, the overall impact on public health remains limited at this stage, as there is currently only one recorded human case and appropriate public health response measures have been implemented, as described above. The risk of international dissemination of WNV from Barbados is low. The virus is primarily transmitted through (C1) mosquito bites (C1), with (C2) birds as the natural hosts (C2). There is no evidence to suggest that WNV spreads easily between humans or from horses to mosquitoes.",human behavior
